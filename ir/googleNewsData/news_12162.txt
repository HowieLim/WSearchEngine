Abrams" href="/topic/entertainment/j.j.-abrams-PECLB005325-topic.html">J.J. Abrams</a>-directed space opera will certainly post huge numbers. But just how big remains to be seen. According to people who have reviewed pre-release audience tracking surveys, the new picture could take in $180 million to $220 million in ticket sales through Sunday in the U.S. and Canada. Analysts say it could eventually bring in $1.5 billion to $2 billion over the course of its global run.Hollywood is waiting to see if &quot;The Force Awakens&quot; can set a new benchmark for the cinema industry, after Universal's &quot;Jurassic World&quot; broke the record for the biggest domestic opening with $208.8 million in June.Helped by a surge in early ticket sales, theaters have been selling out screenings, even at 2 and 5 a.m., and theaters have been adding showtimes around the clock to satisfy the audience appetite.&quot;It's sort of strange that it's actually here,&quot; said Mike Sherrill, chief creative officer of the theater chain Alamo Drafthouse Cinema. &quot;It's crazy. We're selling out shows in the middle of the night. We've never seen demand like this.&quot;Theaters across the country will be open and fully staffed 24 hours a day during opening weekend. Some are holding &quot;Star Wars&quot; marathons starting at 4 a.m. Thursday, where fans will watch all six previous movies in the series before seeing &quot;The Force Awakens.&quot;Last night over three thousand critics, reporters, celebrities and movie makers piled into  different theaters to see the U.S. premiere of <a href="/topic/entertainment/movies/star-wars%3A-the-force-awakens-ENMV002947-topic.html">"Star Wars: The Force Awakens"</a> Here's our completely spoiler-free look at the brand-new "Star Wars" movie and the night that made Hollywood one with the Force,...Last night over three thousand critics, reporters, celebrities and movie makers piled into  different theaters to see the U.S. premiere of <a href="/topic/entertainment/movies/star-wars%3A-the-force-awakens-ENMV002947-topic.html">"Star Wars: The Force Awakens"</a> Here's our completely spoiler-free look at the brand-new "Star Wars" movie and the night that made Hollywood one with the Force,...Walt Disney Co., which has much riding on the revival of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise, has waged a sustained marketing campaign to appeal to the franchise's core fan base and tap into the nostalgia for the original trilogy, which began in 1977. Anticipation drove record-breaking advance ticket sales that reached $50 million by mid-November, a total that has surely grown significantly since then.The hype reached a new level Monday after Disney held the world premiere in Hollywood, where it showed the film in three theaters and closed down four blocks of Hollywood Boulevard for the festivities. Reviews were not yet out Tuesday, but social media posts about the film from those who saw the movie early, including celebrity guests, were overwhelmingly positive. That's a good sign for the film's box-office prospects, said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at the entertainment data firm Rentrak.&quot;There's got to be a collective sigh of relief over at Disney,&quot; Dergarabedian said. &quot;The movie's already feeling the love from social media, and that's very important.&quot;Disney and theater chains have done virtually everything possible to fill as many seats as they can, including promotions offered at certain multiplexes. AMC Theatres, for example, is giving out new &quot;Star Wars&quot; posters to people who buy tickets to see the movie in Imax 3D on Sundays through Jan. 10. In a quirky example, Alamo Drafthouse is unveiling a &quot;Star Wars&quot;-themed dine-in menu designed to look like the Millennium Falcon.Watch the trailer for "Star Wars: The Force Awakens."Watch the trailer for "Star Wars: The Force Awakens."&quot;At that point, you're really talking about what is the capacity of the theater industry to sell tickets and get people into seats,&quot; said Bruce Nash, president of film industry research firm Nash Information Services.Theaters also are taking added security precautions for the big opening, which is expected to draw multitudes of costumed fans, some of whom have been camped out in front of theaters since Dec. 8. Theater safety has been a topic of concern after shootings in Aurora, Colo., in 2012 and Lafayette, La., in July.AMC, the nation's second-largest theater chain, will allow costumes, but not masks, face paint or fake weapons (light sabers are permitted, however). High-end theater company ArcLight Cinemas last week sent an email to customers saying it will not allow large bags, masks or props that could be a safety hazard.Theater chains are counting on &quot;Star Wars&quot; to help push the industry toward a possible record level of business this year and also reinforce the habit of visiting the multiplex at a time when theaters face more competition from entertainment viewing in the home.&quot;Everyone is expecting that 'Star Wars' is going to be a blockbuster with huge revenues on opening night and opening weekend, but I think there's the potential to do more,&quot; said Adam Aron, newly named chief executive of AMC Entertainment. &quot;It will remind people that going to a local movie theater is a wonderful way to spend the night with your family, spouse or significant other.&quot;A weekend of $180 million or more would be unprecedented for a movie released in December. The biggest opening for that month was <a title="The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey" href="/topic/entertainment/movies/the-hobbit%3A-an-unexpected-journey-ENMV0000205-topic.html">&quot;The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,&quot;</a> which grossed $85 million when it premiered in 2012. If &quot;Star Wars&quot; manages to hit the $2-billion mark worldwide, it will join a club that only includes &quot;Avatar&quot; and &quot;Titanic.&quot;It's still unclear whether &quot;Star Wars&quot; will succeed in pushing the domestic box office to an annual record of $11 billion. At the beginning of the year, analysts widely predicted the industry would reach that mark, but the box office lagged in October and November. As of this week, box-office revenue in the U.S. and Canada totaled about $10 billion &#8212; about even with the record pace of 2013.&quot;We're literally neck and neck with the record box office,&quot; Dergarabedian said. &quot;We've got 15 to 16 days to earn a billion dollars in North America, and that's no small feat.&quot;<em>Times staff writer Richard Verrier contributed to this report.</em><strong>MORE:</strong><strong><a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/herocomplex/la-et-hc-star-wars-force-awakens-premiere-live-updates-htmlstory.html">'Star Wars: The Force Awakens': A recap of the world premiere from celebrity cosplay on the red carpet to the first reactions</a></strong><strong><a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-star-wars-disney-empire-20151213-story.html#nt=outfit">How 'Star Wars' could become Disney's next cash cow</a></strong><a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/herocomplex/la-ca-hc-the-women-of-star-wars-the-force-awakens-20151206-htmlstory.html#nt=outfit"><strong>The women of 'Star Wars' speak out about their new Empire</strong></a><strong><a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/herocomplex/la-et-hc-jj-abrams-star-wars-the-force-awakens-20151213-story.html#nt=outfit">J.J.

Moscow claimed it has positioned 10 satellites—representing more than 10 percent of the Russia’s space arsenal—over Syria to map terrain, spot targets and gather other intelligence and relay radio signals between far-flung ground, air and sea forces.Loathe to miss out on opportunity to celebrate its own military exploits, the Kremlin began detailing its space deployment in mid-November, first in official statements and subsequently through state-owned media outlets.And in early December, the Russian government circulated imagery from its satellites in an effort to prove that Turkey—one of Moscow’s rivals in Syria—is helping Islamic State terrorists export oil.&quot;Russia now fields one of the largest and most effective satellite groups in the world, and it has reached a peak of activity amid the military operations in Syria,” crowed Russia Beyond the Headlines, a <a href="http://rbth.com/defence/2015/12/14/new-generations-of-satellites-are-russias-cosmic-eyes-and-ears_550803" target="_blank">government-owned propaganda Website</a>.TOf course, the United States has made space part of its way of war of decades—using satellites to guide bombs, relay signals, and gather intelligence. TheU S. is still by far the world leader in space, with some 400 satellites in Earth orbit, including nearly 200 military models. That’s according to the nonprofit Union of Concerned Scientists, an advocacy group based in Massachusetts. By UCS’ count, Russia possesses the second-largest space force—89 satellites including around 50 belonging to, or working for, the armed forces (<a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/legacy/assets/documents/nwgs/satellites.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>).But it’s true that Moscow has been rebuilding its orbital forces following a post-Cold War period of decline. And, if Kremlin claims are to be believed—and you should always treat Kremlin claims skeptically— it’s also true that some of Russia’s newest and best spacecraft are <a href="/articles/2015/07/23/moscow-could-be-prepping-for-space-war-with-spooky-new-satellites.html">at war over Syria</a>.On Nov. 17, Valery Gerasimov, chief of the Russian military’s general staff, briefed reporters on the space deployment. “10 imagery and electronic warfare reconnaissance satellites, including civilian-use spacecraft, have been involved in reconnaissance,” Gerasimov said, adding that controllers on the ground modified some of the sats’ orbits to focus them on Syria.Gerasimov didn’t specify exactly <i>which </i>satellite types he was talking about, but Anatoly Zak, an author and independent expert on the Russian space program, was able to read between the lines. “Some assumptions can be made based on known data on Russia’s currently operational spacecraft,” Zak wrote on his Website.According to Zak, the 10 satellites include the new Bars-M mapping sat, <a href="http://www.russianspaceweb.com/garpun.html" target="_blank">Garpun radio relays</a>, the Lotos-S electronic eavesdropper and, perhaps most significantly, the modern Resurs-P2 and Persona sats, both of which are essentially high-resolution orbital cameras. In a phrase, “<a href="http://www.russianspaceweb.com/bars-m.html" target="_blank">spy satellites</a>.”Persona is a strictly military system and “the nation’s most advanced reconnaissance satellite,” according to Zak. <a href="http://www.russianspaceweb.com/resurs_p2.html" target="_blank">Resurs-P2</a> is a slightly less sophisticated version of Persona for military <i>and </i>civilian use. “It could be commanded to photograph individual objects on the Earth’s surface as well as to scan swathes of land extending up to 2,000 kilometers,” Zak <a href="http://www.russianspaceweb.com/persona.html" target="_blank">wrote about Resurs-P2</a>.Citing official sources, Zak estimated that Resurs-P2 can photograph 80,000 square kilometers per day in high-resolution mode—roughly half of Syria’s land area.That surveillance prowess came in handy for the Kremlin when, in late November, Russia and Turkey faced off in and around Syria. Where Russia backs al-Assad’s regime in Syria, Turkey walks a fine line between Syrian factions, offering safe haven to some rebel groups while also waging a low-intensity war with Kurdish militants based in Syria.Turkey’s relationship with with ISIS is… complicated. Critics have accused the Turkish government of allowing, if not encouraging, the terror group’s activities along Turkey’s border.On Nov. 24, a Turkish warplane shot down a Russian attack plane that apparently briefly strayed into Turkey’s air space. One Russian crew member died. Moscow retaliated with economic sanctions and, in early December, accused Turkey of facilitating ISIS’s illicit oil exports, which reportedly account for <a href="/articles/2015/11/24/turks-shoot-down-a-russian-fighter.html">half of the terror group’s revenue</a>.On Dec. 3, the Russian defense ministry released imagery—apparently provided by the Persona or Resurs-P2 satellites—that allegedly depict thousands of ISIS oil tankers headed for a Turkish port. At least, that was the Russian claim. Turkey’s president Recep Tayyip Erdogan denied the allegation in no uncertain terms. “Shame on you—those who claim we buy oil from Daesh are obliged to prove it,” Erdogan said, <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2015/11/turkey-assad-ankara-backing-isil-151126155256249.html" target="_blank">using a slang term for ISIS</a>. “If not, you are a slanderer.”Whatever the truth, the imagery is a stark reminder that Russia’s campaign in Syria isn’t just an air, ground, and sea war. Moscow’s Middle East intervention also extends hundreds of miles into space.<img src="http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17913818" height="1" width="1" alt="*">####Vladimir Putin's military is unveiling a new arsenal in its battle with ISIS and other insurgents in Syria.

But it does include a provision Democrats sought, making a child tax credit permanent.- Changes to a visa waiver program that will tighten travel curbs on those who have been in Iraq and Syria;- No "bailout" for Puerto Rico, which is experiencing fiscal difficulties;- Provisions to encourage companies to share cyber data with the U.S. government in its fight against hackers;- The "179" deduction, a tax break small business owners use to buy new equipment, is being made permanent;- A two-year delay in a 2.3 percent excise tax on medical devices and a "Cadillac tax" on high-cost healthcare plans. Representative Tom Cole said the tax package also would include a one-year delay in a tax on health insurance providers.He said it also extends for another year a provision limiting how much the government can spend on "risk corridors" protecting insurers against financial losses under Obama's landmark healthcare law;- A five-year renewal of a program to help first responders and others who suffered illness from exposure to toxins at the World Trade Center site destroyed in the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.Before Congress debates these long-term bills, it is expected on Wednesday to pass another stop-gap funding bill giving lawmakers until Dec. 22 to complete their work. Without the temporary measure, federal funding for a range of government programs expires at midnight on Wednesday.A congressional aide said negotiators were likely to block a proposal to revise certain legal protections for bondholders, a provision that had been pushed by Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid, partly to ease the bankruptcy of casino giant Caesars Entertainment's operating unit.

Hyeon Soo Lim was found guilty of anti-government activities and of spreading false propaganda, the Chinese state news agency Xinhua said. "The supreme court announced that Lim was guilty of joining the United States and South Korea in anti-DPRK human rights 'racket' and fabricating and circulating false propaganda materials tarnishing the country's image," Xinhua said. His punishment: A lifetime of labor, the agency said. Lim, 60, ministers the 3,000-member Light Korean Presbyterian Church in Toronto. He is a Canadian citizen who emigrated from South Korea in 1986.He traveled to North Korea from China on January 30 on a routine humanitarian trip, a spokeswoman for his family said. He was detained in February. Lim had visited the country over 100 times, his family said. On this trip, he planned to tend to aid projects established by his church in the northeastern city of Rajin, including an orphanage, a nursery and a nursing home."It is this tremendous love for the people of the DPRK that motivated Mr. Lim to travel to the nation over 100 times,"  said family spokeswoman Lisa Pak. <h3>Coerced confession</h3>But North Korea painted a different picture of his motivation. In July, Lim was brought out a news conference where he read from a statement, confessing to activities aimed at toppling the North Korean government, according to the country's state-run news agency KCNA."The purpose that I traveled about several parts of the country on the pretext of 'aid' was to build a base to overthrow the system of the country and create a religious state, taking advantage of the policies of the U.S. and South Korean authorities," Lim said, according to the The Associated Press, which was  present for the news conference. AP reported it was delivered in front of a packed room of Pyongyang-based journalists.Westerners held previously in North Korea have said that their confessions were given under pressure from the state.In April, U.S. citizen Sandra Suh was released from detention in the country and deported to the United States after admitting to "plot-breeding and propaganda against the DPRK," according to KCNA.<h3>A second video</h3>In August, North Korea released footage of Lim confessing again -- <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/04/asia/north-korea-detained-pastor-confesses/index.html">this time at a Pyongyang church</a>. "My biggest crime is my act of blindness in severely insulting the highest dignity and system, the DPRK," Lim is shown saying to a church congregation while dressed in a dark suit and tie. The video was posted on Uriminzokkiri, a state-run propaganda website.The church service took place on August 2nd at Pyongyang's Bongsu Church. There are several places of worship in the North Korean capital, including the Protestant church where Lim appeared. It is known to be used for propaganda purposes but run by state-monitored religious associations.<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/04/asia/north-korea-detained-pastor-confesses/index.html">Canadian pastor detained in North Korea confesses to crimes</a><h3>Behind the scenes</h3>Canada has limited diplomatic relations with the reclusive country. But behind the scenes, the Canadian government waged an aggressive campaign to win Lim's freedom, according to a source with knowledge of the proceedings.Two delegations from the Canadian Embassy in Seoul  held backchannel meetings with North Korean officials in Pyongyang, most recently after Canadian Thanksgiving in October.And Canadian consular officials spoke informally with North Korean delegates on the sidelines of United Nations meetings, the source said.In November, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/12/world/hyeon-soo-lim-canadian-north-korea/index.html">a new set of state officials in Canada</a>, loaded into power after the victory of Justin Trudeau and his Liberal Party in a general election last month, were charged with bringing Lim home. <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/12/world/hyeon-soo-lim-canadian-north-korea/index.html">Canada's election gives hope to family of Hyeon Soo Lim</a>CNN's Dave Shortell reported from New York and Vivian Kam from Hong Kong####(CNN) A Canadian pastor, detained in North Korea for 10 months, has now been sentenced to life in prison there "for subversion.#####Wave of arrests after Pakistan school massacre has unclear results####http://www.reuters.com/article/us-pakistan-attacks-idUSKBN0TZ18820151216####<span class="articleLocation">ISLAMABAD</span> Pakistan has arrested nearly 100,000 people under a counter-terrorism program enacted after a massacre of school children a year ago, though only about 2,000 of them were militants, a senior Interior Ministry official told Reuters.  The rare figures on results of the National Action Plan (NAP) could reinforce critics who say it has resulted mostly in indiscriminate clamp downs that do not solve long-standing security problems.A solemn ceremony in the northwestern city of Peshawar commemorated the deaths of 134 children and 19 adults at a military school in a Pakistani Taliban assault, the deadliest militant attack in the country's history.In a speech in Peshawar on Wednesday, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif barely mentioned the plan, instead focusing on the achievements of military offensives.  "We formulated the National Action Plan," he said briefly, but spent most of his time praising military action along the Afghan border that "has broken the back of the terrorists. It has destroyed their hideouts, their training centers and their infrastructure".Pakistan announced the 20-point plan to tackle militancy after the assault on the Army Public School on Dec. 16, 2014. Among its main thrusts are expanded counter-terrorism raids, secret military courts, the resumption of hangings and promises to reform the justice system.Government officials say the plan is working, and no one disputes violence is down. Militant attacks killed an average of 90 people a month this year, down from 136 the previous year. However, several factors have contributed to the drop in violence: ongoing anti-Taliban military operations predating the plan and a continuing downward trend of attacks over the past few years.Many of those arrested under the National Action Plan have been civilians who say they must pay police to release them, like Afghan fruit seller Khaliq Khan in the northwestern town of Dera Ismail Khan."I did not pay them, because I am legal and have a refugee card," he said. "I remained for 3 months in jail, my family is now afraid and thinking of running away from here."COURTS AND POLICEStatistics on arrests and prosecutions under the plan are rarely made public. In February, Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar told parliament that 12,000 suspects had been picked up.However, Reuters on Tuesday viewed updated ministry figures showing that about 95,000 people have been arrested under the NAP.An ministry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed the figure and said only about 2,000 of those were "hard-core" militant suspects and the rest were arrested for other, unspecified crimes.It was unclear how many of those arrested had faced trial and how many had been freed.Military spokesman Asim Bajwa said recently that 142 cases had been referred to special military courts, but other courts can also handle cases under the plan.Bajwa said military courts had seen "31 hardcore terrorists convicted". Little else is known about those on trial or the legal process, concerns sharpened after the government lifted a moratorium on executions. This year, 319 people were hanged, but the vast majority had no known militant connections, data collected by legal aid charity Reprieve showed.

Security Council resolution in October by test-firing a missile capable of delivering a nuclear warhead, a team of sanctions monitors said, leading to calls in the U.S. Congress on Tuesday for more sanctions on Tehran.The White House said it would not rule out additional steps against Iran over the test of the medium-range Emad rocket.  The Security Council's Panel of Experts on Iran said in a confidential report, first reported by Reuters, that the launch showed the rocket met its requirements for considering that a missile could deliver a nuclear weapon."On the basis of its analysis and findings the Panel concludes that Emad launch is a violation by Iran of paragraph 9 of Security Council resolution 1929," the panel said.Diplomats said the rocket test on Oct. 10 was not technically a violation of the July nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers, but the U.N. report could put U.S. President Barack Obama's administration in an awkward position. Iran has said any new sanctions would jeopardise the nuclear deal. But if Washington failed to call for sanctions over the Emad launch, it would likely be perceived as weakness.   Diplomats said it was possible for the U.N. sanctions committee to blacklist additional Iranian individuals or entities, something Washington and European countries are likely to ask for. But they said Russia and China, which dislike the sanctions on Iran's missile programme, might block any such moves.The panel's report was dated last Friday and went to members of the Security Council's Iran sanctions committee in recent days. The report came up on Tuesday when the 15-nation council discussed the Iran sanctions regime.It said the panel considered ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons to be those that can deliver at least a 500-kg (1,102-pound) payload within a range of at least 300 km (185 miles)."The Panel assesses that the launch of the Emad has a range of not less than 1,000 km with a payload of at least 1,000 kg and that Emad was also a launch 'using ballistic missile technology,'" the report said.Iran's U.N. mission did not respond to a request for comment. In October, Tehran disputed the Western assessment that the missile was capable of delivering a nuclear warhead.The panel noted that Iranian rocket launches from 2012 and 2013 also violated the U.N. ban on ballistic missile tests.The chair of the Iran sanctions committee, Spanish Ambassador Roman Oyarzun, told the council the Panel of Experts had concluded the attempt by Iran to procure titanium alloy bars earlier this year also violated U.N. nuclear sanctions.CONGRESSIONAL RESPONSERepublicans in Congress who disapprove of the Iran nuclear deal were seizing on the U.N. panel's findings as grounds for additional congressional sanctions. Even some Democrats supported unilateral U.S. action on the missile violations.Democratic U.S. Senator Chris Coons, a member of the foreign relations panel who backed the Iran nuclear deal, said it was up to the Security Council to act, but if it did not, the United States should, including by imposing direct sanctions on Iranians responsible for the missile tests.While ballistic missile tests may violate U.N. Security Council sanctions, council diplomats note that such launches are not a violation of the nuclear deal, which is foccused on specific nuclear activities by Iran.Iran, which has always rejected sanctions against it as illegal and unjustified, has repeatedly made clear it has no intention of complying with the restrictions on its missile programme.  Asked about the panel's report, British U.N. Ambassador Matthew Rycroft told reporters it was "absolutely crucial that the Security Council upholds its responsibilities and does respond effectively to what appears to have been a breach."The expert panel did not mention a second reported missile test that Iran carried out last month. The panel produced its report after the United States, Britain, France and Germany in October called on the U.N. sanctions committee to take action in response to Iran's test of an Emad missile.Security Council resolution 1929, which bans ballistic missile tests, was adopted in 2010 and remains valid until the nuclear deal is implemented. Under that deal, most sanctions on Iran will be lifted in exchange for curbs on its nuclear programme. According to a July 20 resolution endorsing the deal, Iran is still "called upon" to refrain from work on ballistic missiles designed to deliver nuclear weapons for up to eight years.Although the section of the July 20 resolution applying to missiles is weaker and more limited than the total ban in resolution 1929, U.S. officials have said they will continue to act as if there were a de facto total ban on ballistic missile tests by Iran in the years to come once the nuclear deal is implemented.The experts' report also noted that ballistic missile launches would still be covered by the July 20 resolution.U.S., Iranian and Russian officials have said they expect full implementation of the Iran deal, including the lifting of sanctions, to happen early next year once the U.N. nuclear watchdog confirms Iranian compliance with the agreed restrictions on its atomic work.Earlier on Tuesday, the U.N. nuclear watchdog's 35-nation board in Vienna closed its investigation into whether Iran sought atomic weapons, opting to back the international deal with Tehran rather than dwell on Iran's past activities, diplomats said.U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry welcomed the decision to close the investigation into whether Iran once had a secret nuclear weapons programme.

Data firm Markit’s Composite Output Index, which measures overall activity in the manufacturing and services sector, dropped worryingly close to the 50-point mark, which separates growth from contraction, in December.While economists had predicted that the key gauge would remain unchanged at November’s 51, it fell to 50.3 in December -- a four month low. The index measuring French services activity slipped to 50 from 51, its lowest level since January, while a measure for manufacturing unexpectedly rose to 51.6 from 50.6. The data from France was in sharp contrast with the performance of the euro area, which enjoyed its strongest quarter in over four years.“French private sector output growth nearly ground to a halt at the end of 2015 amid faltering new business intakes. A slowdown in the dominant service sector was the driver, with some panelists indicating that their new business intakes had been impacted following the recent terrorist attacks,” Jack Kennedy, a senior economist at Markit, said, in a <a  href="https://www.markiteconomics.com/Survey//PressRelease.mvc/c76c5619f8bd4b6b8cedc5e7b3064e61" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">statement</a>. “The manufacturing sector picked up momentum, however, bolstered by the sharpest rise in new orders since early-2014.”France continued to lag behind Germany, where the <a  href="https://www.markiteconomics.com/Survey//PressRelease.mvc/0a00514176eb499a9082f46cd317ce44" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Composite Output Index</a> came in at 54.9 in December, close to November’s 55.2The weak data comes just days after the Bank of France <a  href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-economy-idUSKBN0TR17C20151208" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">trimmed</a> its fourth-quarter growth forecast for the country to 0.3 percent from an earlier 0.4 percent, as the Nov. 13 attacks took their toll on activity in the hotel, leisure and restaurant sectors.For the euro area, Markit’s <a  href="https://www.markiteconomics.com/Survey//PressRelease.mvc/b35e86f6e5ff4a8788bb7e7b5b43a437" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Purchasing Managers’ Index</a> (PMI) data for the month of December stood at 54 -- close to November’s 54.2 -- an uptick in orders pushed the employment growth rate to its highest level since May 2011, indicating that companies are optimistic about the region’s economic growth.“Although the PMI edged lower in December, the fourth quarter as a whole saw the largest increase in business activity for four-and-a-half years,” Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said, in a statement. “The survey is signaling a quarterly GDP rise of 0.4 percent, meaning the region grew 1.5 percent in 2015.”A preliminary reading of the eurozone manufacturing PMI for December rose to 53.1 from 52.8 in November -- a 20-month high.The IBT Pulse Newsletter keeps you connected to the biggest stories unfolding in the global economy.<img alt="Clicky" width="1" height="1" src="//in.getclicky.com/238279ns.gif" />####ParisCafe_Dec2015 Markit's survey showed France's services sector took a hit - in contrast to other euro area economies -- after the Nov. 13 attacks in Paris that killed 130 people.#####Valeant Cuts 2016 Earnings Forecast Ahead of Investor Day####http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-16/valeant-cuts-2016-earnings-forecast-ahead-of-investor-day#### Connecting decision makers to a dynamic network of information, people and ideas, Bloomberg quickly and accurately delivers business and financial information, news and insight around the world.

On Tuesday, state regulators proposed new fees for solar customers.Solar proponents have been rallying to block changes to rooftop solar costs. On Tuesday, state regulators proposed new fees for solar customers.Rooftop solar panel owners could face new fees under a proposal issued Tuesday, but state regulators rejected several recommendations by utility companies that threatened the expansion of residential and commercial solar efforts.Southern California Edison and the state's other big investor-owned utilities had pushed to charge more for homes and businesses with rooftop solar panels to connect to the electric grid and use power from utilities when needed. The companies also advocated paying lower rates to panel owners who sold them their extra electricity.Despite the utilities' campaign, the California Public Utilities Commission largely backed the solar industry, which had said the power companies' proposals could have devastated its business.Under the PUC plan, new solar customers would face a one-time fee for connection to the electric grid. The commission estimates that the fee would range from $75 to $150 per solar customer.In addition, rooftop solar customers would pay a fee of 2 cents to 3 cents per kilowatt-hour for electricity used from the utility companies, no matter how much power their solar systems generate. This fee would amount to about $5 a month for the average solar user.California's aggressive push to increase renewable energy production comes with a catch for people with solar panels on the roof: You don't count.If a home or business has a rooftop solar system, most of the wattage isn't included in the ambitious requirement to generate half of the state's electricity...California's aggressive push to increase renewable energy production comes with a catch for people with solar panels on the roof: You don't count.If a home or business has a rooftop solar system, most of the wattage isn't included in the ambitious requirement to generate half of the state's electricity...Utilities also would place new solar customers on time-of-use rates, which rise during periods of high electricity demand.Existing owners are exempted from all the changes for 20 years from when they installed their solar systems and connected to the grid.Sara Kamins, supervisor of the PUC's customer generation program, said the proposed changes are designed to get rooftop solar owners to pay their fair share for maintaining the electric system while ensuring that the added fees don't harm solar-panel owners.The 2-cent to 3-cent fee, Kamins said, helps to pay for programs such as energy-efficiency efforts that benefit disadvantaged communities.&#8220;We're still figuring out what a solar customer's fair share is,&#8221; Kamins said.As for the connection charge &#8212; previously borne by all utility customers &#8212; &#8220;We think they can pay that fee without jeopardizing the economics of the installation,&#8221; she said.The PUC will accept public comment on the proposed fees through mid-January and is expected to make a final decision at its Jan. 28 meeting.At issue is the practice of net metering, in which utilities credit solar users for surplus power their systems create; that electricity gets fed back into the grid for use by other customers. Solar users are credited at the same rate they would pay the utility for electricity.Kamins said the proposed decision leaves the current net metering policy largely intact.<strong><a href="http://www.facebook.com/latimes">See more of our top stories on Facebook &gt;&gt;</a></strong>The PUC's overhaul of the old solar rules was mandated by the state Legislature, which wanted to encourage the continued growth of rooftop solar installations while spreading costs fairly to all electricity users. The new rules would take effect by July 2017.Utility proposals called for changes such as crediting solar users at about half the current rates. Utilities also wanted to charge monthly fees based on the size of a homeowner's solar system, which would have been higher than what the commission is proposing.Southern California Edison decried the proposed decision as insufficient and unfair to non-solar customers.&#8220;SCE wants rooftop solar to expand in California, and there is a more balanced way to get this done,&#8221; said Ron Nichols, Edison's senior vice president of regulatory affairs. &#8220;A much more fair approach would maintain some level of subsidy, but at far lower levels, while rooftop solar continues to grow.&#8221;San Diego Gas &amp; Electric expressed disappointment &#8220;that today's proposed decision on the rooftop solar subsidy does not address the growing cost burden among our customers. Workable solutions must be developed to create a future where all customers can receive benefits.&#8221;&#8220;We will continue to engage the CPUC with the hope of finding a better solution than what is in today's proposed decision,&#8221; the utility said in a statementPacific Gas &amp; Electric said the proposed decision &#8220;falls well short of what is needed to ensure sustainable growth of solar.&#8221;&#8220;Consumer advocates and environmentalists alike agree that change in solar rates is needed,&#8221; Steve Malnight, PG&amp;E's senior vice president of regulatory affairs, said in a statement.&#8220;Some solar company executives will say that the sky is falling if we make any changes, but the truth is that solar's bright future will only be assured by moving forward with smart energy reform. Solar is too important to our state's energy future not to get it right,&#8221; Malnight said.The debate over California solar costs could shape solar policies throughout the nation as utilities seek ways to tinker with the costs and benefits of solar. Other states look to California as an innovator on solar policy. The state by far leads the nation in deployment of rooftop and utility-scale solar technology, followed by Arizona, New Jersey, North Carolina and Nevada.Onerous fees could make solar-power systems unaffordable, industry representatives said.Solar proponents praised the commission's proposed decision and said they looked forward to an even stronger final version for consumers.&#8220;We support the PUC's proposed decision to continue the state's successful net metering policy,&#8221; said Lyndon Rive, chief executive of rooftop solar giant SolarCity. Rive said the proposed decision &#8220;recognizes the important role of rooftop solar in accelerating our transition to a clean energy economy and providing customer choice.Bernadette Del Chiaro, director of the California Solar Energy Industries Assn., said: &#8220;Gov. [Jerry] Brown's PUC is standing up for clean power and for customers by proposing to reject the utilities' attempts to make solar out of reach for customers.&#8221;ivan.penn@latimes.com<strong>Twitter:&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/ivanlpenn" target="_blank">@ivanlpenn</a></strong><strong>ALSO</strong><strong><a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-obamacare-enrollment-20151215-story.html" target="_blank">Deadline to sign up for health coverage extended as applicants flood Obamacare website</a></strong><strong><a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-et-ct-california-ag-harris-comcast-hazardous-waste-settlement-20151215-story.html" target="_blank">California reaches $26-million settlement with Comcast over electronic waste</a></strong><strong><a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-howard-stern-siriusxm-20151214-story.html" target="_blank">Howard Stern signs a new five-year deal with SiriusXM</a></strong><strong>9:23 p.m.:</strong> Updates with additional details and backgroundOriginally posted at 12:41 p.m.Rooftop solar panel owners could face new fees under a proposal issued Tuesday, but state regulators rejected several recommendations by utility companies that threatened the expansion of residential and commercial solar efforts.Southern California Edison and the state\'s other big investor-owned...####Solar proponents have been rallying to block changes to rooftop solar costs.

But, Facebook made clear that it is not backing off from its policy that people at the social network should use names that friends and family know them by, and not those intended to hide who they really are. "When people use the names they are known by, their actions and words carry more weight because they are more accountable for what they say," said an online post by product manager Todd Gage and vice president of global operations Justin Osofsky. "It also makes it harder for bullies to anonymously smear the reputations of others, or anyone else to use an anonymous name to harass, scam or engage in criminal behavior." Drag queens who got word late last year that their accounts using stage names were at risk sparked a high-profile protest joined by activists, domestic violence victims and others who want to avoid having real names on social network profiles. The list of people understandably interested in using assumed names at Facebook goes far beyond drag queens to judges, social workers, teachers, entertainers, abuse victims and others, according to activists. In the past, people could get an account suspended by simply tagging a name as fake at the social network. Those reporting suspected fake names to Facebook must now provide more information, such as the reason for their concern. "We're also testing a new tool that will let people provide more information about their circumstances if they are asked to verify their name," the online post said. "People can let us know they have a special circumstance, and then give us more information about their unique situation." Teams at Facebook use the additional information for context while reviewing reports of names being fake, according to Gage and Osofsky. Other changes made by Facebook during the past year include expanding options for verifying names and letting people keep access to social network accounts while going through the process. "Early in the new year, we will be looking at other ways we can reduce the number of people who have to go through an ID verification experience, while preserving the safety of other people on the site," Gage and Osofsky said. Facebook late last year vowed to ease its "real names" policy after publicly apologizing to quell a simmering dispute over its enforcement of the policy. Facebook executives and representatives of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities collaborated on a solution deemed acceptable to both sides, allowing people to use assumed names, subject to verification.Refrain from posting comments that are obscene, defamatory or inflammatory, and do not indulge in personal attacks, name calling or inciting hatred against any community. <strong>Help us delete comments</strong> that do not follow these guidelines <strong>by marking them offensive</strong>.

Google has launched a new online game called &ldquo;<a href="https://lightsaber.withgoogle.com/">Lightsaber Escape</a>,&rdquo; which follows Finn&mdash;the star of the new Star Wars film, <em>The Force Awakens</em>&mdash;using his ancient weapon to take on a group of stormtroopers.To play, you&rsquo;ll need a computer and a phone, and a bit of space. Head to the <a href="https://lightsaber.withgoogle.com/">game&rsquo;s site</a> using Chrome&mdash;it will prompt you to enter a unique URL on your phone&rsquo;s browser, which will turn the phone into your lightsaber.

No muss, no fuss.Just the way he wanted it. Ryan had discussed retirement for months, but never offered any specific timetable."It is so emotional right now, and I'm trying to hold this together," Ryan said as he began to wrap up his remarks.He had a prepared speech ready to go, printed on a white piece of paper, but decided at the last second to set it aside and speak from the heart in his last news conference as head coach."Can't put that into words," Ryan said. "I can't do that. I've got to tell you how I feel."It was classic Bo — rarely shy to hold back, whether it was about a call, his team or the future.And it's in part what started the "Will he or won't he?" retire drama in the first place.Ryan, who turns 68 on Sunday, said in June this would be his last season. He had told athletic director Barry Alvarez of his plans after the Final Four in April, but Alvarez advised him to give it some time, and not to make a decision right after the end of the season.At a charity golf event in August, Ryan left the door open to return.In making his announcement on Tuesday, Ryan revealed another factor in the timing. He said he would have retired in June, but associate head coach Greg Gard's father had just been diagnosed with brain cancer.Ryan said the demands on Gard's time to fly around the country meeting with doctors and helping his dad put his retirement on the back burner. The elder Gard died on Oct. 30.Ryan later talked to Alvarez. He said that he came to a decision in recent weeks that the semester break would be a good time to step down.Gard was named the interim head coach by Alvarez."Every coach would like their top assistant to be the coach," Ryan said after the 64-49 victory in his final game.Gard is considered one of the top assistants in the game. He has worked with Ryan for 20 seasons, including 14-plus years in Madison.He still has a tough act to follow.With 364 victories, Ryan is Wisconsin's winningest coach.Ryan finished with a career mark of 747-233, good for 27th on the NCAA career wins list when counting successful tenures at Wisconsin-Milwaukee and Division III Wisconsin-Platteville. He won four national titles at Platteville.But it's in the Big Ten where Ryan especially made his mark with 14 straight NCAA appearances and seven conference championships. In 2014-15, his final full season, Wisconsin finished a school record 36-4 and advanced to the NCAA title game, losing to Duke.Those squads relied on upperclassmen and defense in an era of one-of-done headliners. Ryan molded offensive stars, for sure, like Sam Dekker and 2014-15 national player of the year Frank Kaminsky, but players knew they had to play defense and play with smarts to earn time."Thank you Coach Ryan for molding me into a young man," Dekker, who is now a rookie with the Houston Rockets, posted on Twitter. Dekker left after his junior season."Wish I could argue with you one more time," Dekker wrote. "All love to Pops!!"Ryan drew national criticism in 2012 when he tried to restrict forward Jarrod Uthoff from transferring from Wisconsin to another Big Ten school. Uthoff ended up transferring anyway to his home state Iowa Hawkeyes after redshirting for a season.Ryan could certainly be brusque. He tended to have a relatively quiet sideline demeanor during games, but wasn't shy to express his displeasure with calls.Ryan seemed to be in his element especially at practice, where he loved to teach.  Off the court, he could be a charmer and command a room with his stories.A native of the Philadelphia suburb of Chester, Ryan still had a hint of a Philly accent and street-smart persona even after all these years in Midwest.He considered it a joy to be able to lead the Badgers six months longer than he had anticipated."But I knew, I knew the energy level ... the speaking, the traveling, the trying to do other things, to help other people — I enjoy doing it, but the thing was, I felt it was time," said Ryan, his eyes appearing to well up with tears. "But I couldn't make the decision at the time."That time finally came on Tuesday.___Follow Genaro Armas at http://twitter.com/GArmasAP<em>Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The rest of the Los Angeles Lakers rolled right along with him to a comfortable win.In a rough farewell campaign, Bryant knows it's important to savor good times such as the Lakers' biggest blowout in two seasons.Bryant had 22 points and six assists during a 113-95 victory over the Bucks on Tuesday night in Milwaukee's first game since ending Golden State's unbeaten run at 24-0 to start the season.D'Angelo Russell had 19 points and seven assists as the Lakers took a 22-point lead in the third quarter and cruised to their second victory in 15 games, snapping a six-game skid and improving to 4-21. Lou Williams scored 16 points, while Julius Randle had 14 points and 14 rebounds.Bryant got "M-V-P!" chants throughout the night, and the crowd chanted his name while he relaxed on the bench with the Lakers up 20 in the closing minutes."For me, it's even more special because I want to appreciate every chance to come to this arena," Bryant said. "Just taking it all in, because I know it'll be over in the bat of an eye."Michael Carter-Williams scored 19 points for the Bucks, who played without leading scorer Greg Monroe in their first game since snapping the Warriors' 28-game winning streak dating to last season."It's very humbling," said John Henson, who scored six points while starting in Monroe's place.Monroe was a late scratch with a sore left knee for the Bucks, who have lost 10 straight road games."We missed Moose tonight," Milwaukee coach Jason Kidd said. "But we're not putting this on Moose being out. This is about the guys who had the uniform on tonight didn't give any effort.""We were just kind of going through some things, then somebody tripped and kind of fell into his legs," Henson said. "It happens. So you've got to be ready."They pushed their lead to 18 points in the third quarter on a four-point play by Bryant. Moments later, Los Angeles was up by 22 — its largest lead at any point in the entire season.Los Angeles finished with its largest margin of victory since March 30, 2014 — two seasons, 115 games and 26 wins ago."I think this is the blueprint tonight of how we've got to play every game," said Jordan Clarkson, who had 11 points."He is one of the best to ever play this game, and given the opportunity, he can embarrass you," Kidd said. "And he did that tonight."Bryant shot an airball on his first attempt, but later hit four straight to finish the first quarter with 10 points. He hit three 3-pointers and finished 7 for 15 from the field, building on his improved shooting in the past four games."My legs feel much better," said Bryant, who complained of severe fatigue early in the season. "I feel in a better rhythm. Feels like my legs kind of caught up.""No," he said. "Honestly, no."<strong>TIP-INS</strong><strong>PHOTOS: NBA photo of the day</strong>A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. <em>Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The LA Times then <a href="http://nymag.com/following/2015/12/la-times-is-serena-better-than-a-horse.html">tweeted a picture of Williams and Pharaoh</a> in a split shot with the question, “Who’s the real sportsperson of 2015?”The initial LA Times online coverage of the decision to honor Williams ran with the question, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-sn-serena-williams-american-pharoah-sports-illustrated-20151214-htmlstory.html">“Are fans right to be upset that Serena Williams beat American Pharaoh for Sportsperson of the year?”</a> Is this really the question? A better question is: Are Black people right to be upset about the continued, blatant, unmitigated racism of the American public? This piece also made sure to mention that SI chose to honor Williams “for reasons that hang in the grayer, less comfortable ether, where issues such as race and femininity collide at the games.” In the very next paragraph, Chuck Schilken argues that American Pharaoh has been “put at a great disadvantage,” because unlike Williams who showed a spirit of sportsmanship by returning to Indian Wells in 2015 after being the subject of racial slurs there in 2001, “horses can’t really display sportsmanship.”Forgive me for this, but: What kind of bullshit is this?Schilken seems dangerously close to making an argument that Serena Williams bested American Pharaoh not because of the her unprecedented record of consecutive grand slam wins, but rather because of affirmative action. To suggest that the horse is at a disadvantage for this award because a horse can’t experience racism is, simply put, whack. And also egregious.The article, like many of the angry tweets, noted that while Pharaoh won the Triple Crown, Serena did not win the Career Grand Slam. A Career Grand Slam means that a tennis player wins all of the major opens in a calendar year. To be clear, the substance of this designation is the winning of four consecutive slams. Serena has not won all consecutive slams in a calendar year. But she has won all four slams consecutively twice. From 2002-2003, she won every Slam, from the French Open to the Australian. She was 21 years old. This year, at age 33, she completed that feat again having won every slam from the U.S. Open in 2014 to Wimbledon in 2015. She is the only tennis player ever to have won all four slams consecutively twice. In fact, this accomplishment has its own name – the “Serena Slam.” And that kind of excellent defiance of convention is precisely why Serena Williams is the greatest women’s tennis player of all time. The only one still in the running at this point is the great Steffi Graf, a player I grew up watching, the only player to ever accomplish a Career Grand Slam, and the player with the most Grand Slam titles. Graf holds 22 to Serena’s 21.But here’s the thing: Aficionados of women’s tennis are well aware of Serena’s accomplishments. Serena still routinely wins tournaments and slams, and she is usually the oldest player in the draw when she does so. The only player who is older is her sister Venus.Still, many commenters spent their time this week actually debating the merits of a horse receiving a “sportsperson of the year” award. It is only the curiosity that is American racism, which demands that we actually defend Williams’ victories against the accomplishments of one animal. What this unique blend of American racism and sexism that Black women experience keeps teaching us is that Black bodies have the uncanny ability to throw notions of personhood deep into flux. Americans have not, in fact, arrived at a historical moment where it is OK to compare Black women’s athletic prowess to the athletic prowess of animal and then act surprised that Black people react to the specter of chattel slavery. But since people are obsessed with comparisons, let&#8217;s be clear: American Pharaoh would have to win the Triple Crown twice to even be in Serena’s league.The continued debate about Serena’s importance and greatness in the history of American tennis and American sports is comparable to debates about Michael Jordan, for instance. While I find conversations challenging the greatness of these two athletes to be entirely asinine, I can also generally chalk such talk up to the pugilistic nature of American sports discourse. In clearer terms, I understand such conversations to be hateration.But the refusal to forthrightly acknowledge that it is simply unacceptable to compare one of our greatest athletes to an animal tells us of the piss-poor depths to which American racial discourse has sunk. If fans of American Pharaoh want to cheer the horse and use this as an opportunity to argue for the right of the horse to be treated as a person, that is entirely their right to do so. But the arguments we make don’t exist in a vacuum. In the United States, any person who makes such claims makes them from the grammar book of American racism and chattel slavery. The ur-text of Black personhood in this country has been the U.S. system of chattel slavery in which no distinctions are made between the treatment or value of animals and the treatment or value of people. Those white people (and they were mostly white people) who feel justified in their disdain for Serena and defense of “American Pharaoh” fit within a long history of other white Americans who have readily argued and acted as though animals should be treated better than Black human beings.And the LA Times&#8217; disingenuous coverage of this whole nasty incident illustrates why racial discourse in this country is so poor. In <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/readers-rep/la-rr-sportsman-of-the-year-debate-20151214-story.html">a follow-up piece</a> in response to the social media backlash against the Times&#8217; coverage, the paper did a great job of “white-splaining” that “the headline and tweet didn’t make clear that the poll [at the LA Times] was prompted by SI’s selection of Williams versus its readers’ support for American Pharaoh.&#8221;&#8220;Readers believed The Times itself was comparing Williams and the thoroughbred,&#8221; the Times suggested, &#8220;and found that offensive.&#8221;But let&#8217;s get one thing straight: The LA Times was wrong and racially offensive. They visually framed this story as Black woman versus horse, and whatever their intention, they trafficked in a widely known and deeply offensive set of racial stereotypes for the purposes of getting clicks. This is therefore not merely a problem of readers with good sense “believing” the wrong thing.Horses are not people. Horses cannot be sportspersons of the year. Yes, in this historic moment the U.S. remains unclear on what it means to be a person. The Supreme Court thinks corporations are people. The religious right thinks fetuses are people. Everyday racists are willing to stake their bets on the claim that horses are people, too. That such ideas necessarily undercut the humanity of Black people, and Black women in particular, conveniently goes unacknowledged in public discourse.We cannot afford at any level to go back to a world in which the personhood of Black people is debatable. At any level. That premise – that Black people are not persons— remains one of this country’s two original evils. (Native American genocide is the first.) This belief undergirds 250 years of slavery, another century of dehumanizing and violent atrocities against Black citizens and now finds us in this moment in the midst of a social movement whose premise is merely to prove that Black lives have value.The great irony here is the horse’s name: “American Pharaoh.” His defenders continue to ride for him with Pharasaic levels of zeal.

Unprecedented. Landmark. Also, the world's greatest diplomatic success. A turning point for the world. This is some of the language used to describe the global climate agreement reached this week in Paris. The excitement about this agreement is palpable, for good reason. <a href="http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2015/cop21/eng/l09.pdf" target="_hplink">The Paris Agreement</a> marks a fundamental turning point in the future of the planet, a conscious vote by the world community to acknowledge that climate change represents an "urgent and potentially irreversible threat to human societies and the planet" and to try, finally, to avoid leaving our children and grandchildren with a dangerously changed global climate. Following the success in Paris, my Twitter and Facebook feeds, emails, and social media posts filled with "glass-half-full and "glass-half-empty" comments from friends and colleagues. Most are hugely excited and optimistic; some wish much more had been accomplished. Despite the acclaim, no one thinks or claims that the agreement is strong enough or by itself will solve the climate problem. National commitments to cut carbon pollution, despite being unprecedented, are still inadequate to meet the targets set and they will have to be reassessed and readjusted over time. Too little money has been committed to help poorer nations adapt to unavoidable climate impacts. Some committed climate activists criticize the failure to set a clear price on carbon emissions or create a global carbon market or adequately protect developing countries that still need to greatly expand their energy use as they transition out of poverty and misery. And the ultimate success of the agreement will depend on how countries implement it moving forward.But we must not fail to recognize the importance of this cusp in time. A week ago, we were heading blindly and recklessly toward a world with an out-of-control climate. Today, the global community has rejected that world and jointly and unanimously decided to seek a different future.There will be winners and losers. Among the losers will be those countries and companies that fundamentally rely on the emission of carbon pollution but that are unable to evolve and shift their economic strategies and priorities. Already, we've seen the financial markets punishing the coal industry. Other losers will be oil and gas companies and countries whose economies rely heavily on finding, extracting, and selling fossil fuels. Such shifts have happened before as new technologies replace old ones, but the magnitude of the needed shift away from fossil fuels is larger than anything we've experienced in the past.The climate denial industry - and it is an industry - also took it on the chin. Like any group that holds beliefs contradicted by science and observed facts, climate deniers have been in decline for some time. While there will always be a hard core set of people stridently unable or unwilling to accept the reality of climate science, that group is getting smaller and becoming more irrelevant as the realities of human-caused climate changes continue to manifest themselves. The agreement in Paris starkly highlighted the marginalization of climate denial.Among the winners will be new businesses and new efforts to develop and deploy low- or zero-carbon energy technologies. Renewable energy in particular has at last matured to the point that it is a truly viable alternative to fossil fuels economically, socially, and politically. This development alone has made the possibility of an alternative climate future possible.Strong science, and the role of science-based communication and advocacy, has also been vindicated. Understanding how humans might actually change the climate - the most complex geophysical system on the planet - has required thousands of scientists in dozens of different fields, the most sophisticated computers and mathematical models ever created, and new technologies to collect data and observations from the top of the atmosphere to the bottom of the oceans, from the poles to the equator. But it also required us to do something we are often uncomfortable or unprepared to do: communicate our findings to the public and policy makers in new, clearer, and compelling ways. For some, the nature of our findings led us to become more active as concerned public citizens, parents, and grandparents in trying to convince politicians to act on ever-strengthening scientific warnings. The true winners from successful implementation of the Paris Agreement will be our children, grandchildren, and all future generations. The climate is still changing far too fast and in dangerous ways. Tomorrow's climate will still be unlike anything our current civilization grew up with. But we now see a path to a different future and we have taken the first courageous steps along that path.
