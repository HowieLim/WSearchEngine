####Unprecedented school closures leave LA inconvenienced, annoyed but undaunted####http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-school-closures-inconvenience-20151215-story.html####Ana Rodriguez awoke to disturbing voices on the television.The sixth-grader thought she heard that police had found a bomb at her school, Sunrise Elementary in Boyle Heights.She thought about her teachers and worried that it could still be there when she returned.&nbsp;&#8220;I&#8217;m scared that a bomb could explode at my school,&#8221; she said.As the unprecedented closure of every Los Angeles school unfolded Tuesday in response to a bomb threat that turned out to be false, fear and confusion inevitably followed.Tens of thousands of parents found their workday routines thrown into turmoil, struggling to get babysitters on short notice, dragging kids to work, or negotiating with their employers for an unscheduled day off.The disruption may have been &nbsp;a factor in the death of a 17-year-old boy, who was apparently walking to International Charter High School with his backpack on when he was struck and killed by a city truck in Highland Park.But mostly parents, students and teachers responded with patience, some annoyance and a lot of aplomb.With one hand, Rafael Velazquez gripped the hand of his 9-year-old daughter and in the other, he held a full box of fruit snacks and chocolate bars.&nbsp;Together they walked down Evergreen Avenue in Boyle Heights, the girl shouting &#8220;Dulce, Dulce! Un d&oacute;lar!&#8221; to anyone within earshot.Velazquez was on his normal sales route in Boyle Heights, but on Tuesday he had an unaccustomed helper in Yesenia, who was home from Euclid Elementary.After hearing of the bomb threat, he decided to not go out and sell and instead keep Yesenia with him at home. But his daughter convinced him that they weren&#8217;t in danger. She wanted to spend the day on a walk with her dad.&nbsp;&#8220;So we decided to sell for a little while,&#8221; he said in Spanish.Michael Jones was one of the few parents who didn&#8217;t hear the news and drove his two first-graders to Garvanza Elementary School in Highland Park.At the closed front door he reached Principal Jennifer Gage on the intercom.&nbsp;&#8220;There&#8217;s no school today. Take your son home,&#8221; she said.&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221; Jones asked.&#8220;School is closed for the day,&#8221; Gage said.&#8220;Come back tomorrow.&#8221;Jones returned to the car looking perplexed.&#8220;I&#8217;m so confused,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What&#8217;s wrong. I know it ain&#8217;t Christmas. What happened?&#8221;Some teachers made long commutes before learning their schools were closed.Alan Glasband, a substitute teacher at San Pedro High School, told The Times by telephone that he only received the news from a friend by text.Another friend, he said, had driven nearly all the way from his home in Norwalk to Orville Wright Middle School near Los Angeles International Airport before he heard the news.&#8220;I&#8217;m pretty distraught that they didn&#8217;t bother to tell us,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It feels like LAUSD doesn&#8217;t value its teachers.&#8221;For some students the prospect of an unexpected day off was not exactly welcome.Jose Chavez, a senior, said he was halfway to&nbsp;school about&nbsp;7:20 when their mother called and told him to come home.&quot;I thought she was joking at first,&quot; said Chavez, who goes to school with his two brothers, Kevin and Joel. &quot;Especially since its finals.&quot;Kevin Chavez, a junior at Franklin High School in Highland Park, said he stayed up until 12:30 Tuesday morning reading &quot;The Crucible&quot; for his literature final. &quot;It would be better to just take the test now,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm more of a math guy.&quot;The Chavez brothers&nbsp;then walked their mother to work and came home to help babysit their 2-year-old nephew.They said they weren't happy to miss school, especially because the delay would probably mean they would have to continue to study for finals even though they were unsure when they would actually take the tests.For Sarah Nichols of Echo Park, the main challenge was figuring out how to explain the change in routine to her children.Pushing her 1-year-old in a stroller, Nichols walked to Sandra Cisneros Learning Academy with her sons, 6 and 7, and her daughter, 5, even though she had heard it was closed.&nbsp;She planned to keep her kids with her for the day.&nbsp;&quot;I would prefer for them to be with me under the circumstances,&quot; she said.&nbsp;She said she didn't want to explain to them what terrorism was, what kind of danger might have awaited. She just told them it &quot;wasn't safe to go to school today.&quot;&nbsp;&quot;I didn't go into detail because I didn't want their little minds to wander,&quot; she said.The threat that prompted Los Angeles Unified School District officials to close all schools Tuesday appears to be a hoax, a U.S. congressman on the House Intelligence Committee said."The preliminary assessment is that it was a hoax or something designed to disrupt school districts in large cities....The threat that prompted Los Angeles Unified School District officials to close all schools Tuesday appears to be a hoax, a U.S. congressman on the House Intelligence Committee said."The preliminary assessment is that it was a hoax or something designed to disrupt school districts in large cities....&nbsp;Still, they asked questions, her daughter asked: &quot;Mommy, what's going to happen?&quot;&nbsp;She told them: &quot;Let's just pray about it. Let's just pray to God that he keeps all the kids safe.&quot;Employers found ways of coping.Pinnacle Designs, a souvenir importer in San Fernando, set up a child care center in a conference room. Staff members stocked it with cider, hot cocoa, movies, coloring books and board games.Only two children ended up using the service.But the company said it would open it again Wednesday if schools remain closed so no employees would have to use sick or vacation days.&#8220;That way, people don&#8217;t have to worry about their kids -- they&#8217;re here,&#8221; said Alayna Nord, director of human resources.At the Los Angeles office of global engineering firm Arup, calls and emails started filtering in very early from parents who had to make last-minute arrangements.Most of those ended up working from home for the rest of the day, said Jon Phillips, who heads the office.&#8220;We&#8217;ve always had a pretty flexible workspace, so people know they can take the opportunity to work from home if they need to,&#8221; Phillips said.The firm prepared for such an emergency after Hurricane Sandy shut down its New York office for several weeks in 2012, he said. Employees are equipped with laptops they are supposed to bring home each night.But Arup has also welcomed any marooned students into the office.&nbsp;&#8220;Every now and again you&#8217;ll pass a desk with someone who&#8217;s 12 years old,&#8221; he said.At Harbor City Narbonne, football coach Manuel Douglas spent the morning looking for another school that would let his players practice.Narbonne is the only Los Angeles high school still playing in a state football bowl game.Later Tuesday, Douglas said Gardena Serra Coach Scott Altenberg had made his practice field available for Tuesday afternoon, and Douglas said he'll have the team walk through drills since they don&#8217;t have equipment.&quot;We got no cleats, no shoulder pads, no helmets,&quot; he said. &quot;As long as we have a football and place to use it, we'll figure it out,&quot; he said.Four 15-year-olds convened at the Omelette and Waffle shop when they couldn&#8217;t go to class at San Pedro High School.The students said reaction among their classmates has been mixed. Some were taking it seriously but others were blas&eacute;.&quot;Our generation is used to it, that's why,&quot; said Jennifer De Jesus.&quot;That's sad too,&quot; said Solina Garcia.&#8220;It's been on TV since we were babies,&quot; said Cienna Cruz. &quot;Since 9/11 and through all the terrorist attacks that have happened it's a reason we should be taking it seriously.&quot;&nbsp;The students said much has changed because of terrorist attacks.They are required to wear neon vests whenever they are walking outside of their classrooms while they're in session. And they recently had a school lockdown drill. Next they'll practice what to do if&nbsp;students are outside during an attack.&quot;Because it can happen at any time,&quot; Jennifer saidOutside, they notice the heavy presence of police cars. They talked about how the school district was being criticized for overreacting.&quot;How do you overreact to a threat?&#8221; Solina asked. &quot;It's better to overreact.&quot;<em>Times staff writers Stephen Ceasar, Eric Sondheimer, Teresa Watanabe,&nbsp;Chris Kirkham and Samantha Masunaga contributed to this report.</em><strong>Twitter: <a href="http://twitter.com/LATDoug">@LATDoug @haileybranson @LATvives @byjsong</a></strong><strong>MORE ON THE LAUSD CLOSURES:</strong><strong><a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-threat-closed-l-a-schools-what-parents-need-to-know-20151215-story.html">What parents need to know</a></strong><strong><a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-boy-17-fatally-struck-by-a-city-service-truck-near-school-closed-after-threat-20151215-story.html">Student killed crossing street after LAUSD closed all schools</a></strong><strong><a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-while-l-a-closed-schools-new-york-found-threat-not-to-be-credible-20151215-story.html">L.A.

Security Council resolution in October by test firing a missile capable of delivering a nuclear warhead, a team of sanctions monitors said, leading to calls in the U.S. Congress on Tuesday for more sanctions on Tehran.The White House warned that it would not rule out additional steps against Iran over the test of the medium-range Emad rocket.  The Security Council's Panel of Experts on Iran said in a confidential new report, first reported by Reuters, that the launch showed the rocket met its requirements for considering that a missile could deliver a nuclear weapon."On the basis of its analysis and findings the Panel concludes that Emad launch is a violation by Iran of paragraph 9 of Security Council resolution 1929," the panel said.   Diplomats say the rocket test on Oct. 10 was not technically a violation of the July nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers but the U.N. report could put President Barack Obama's administration in an awkward position. Iran has said that any new sanctions would jeopardize the nuclear deal but if Washington failed to call for sanctions over the Emad launch it would likely be perceived as weakness.   Diplomats say it is possible for the U.N. sanctions committee to blacklist additional Iranian individuals or entities, something Washington and European countries are likely to ask for. However, they said Russia and China, which dislike the sanctions on Iran's missile program, might block any such moves.The panel's 10-page report was dated Dec. 11 and went to members of the United Nations Security Council's Iran sanctions committee in recent days. The report came up on Tuesday when the 15-nation council discussed the Iran sanctions regime.It said the panel considers ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons to be those that can deliver at least a 500 kg (1,102 lb) payload within a range of at least 300 km (186 miles)."The Panel assesses that the launch of the Emad has a range of not less than 1,000 km with a payload of at least 1,000 kg and that Emad was also a launch 'using ballistic missile technology'," the report said.The panel noted that Iranian rocket launches from 2012 and 2013 also violated the U.N. ban on ballistic missile tests. CONGRESS RESPONSERepublicans in Congress who disapprove of the Iran nuclear deal were seizing on the U.N. panel's findings as grounds for additional congressional U.S. sanctions. Even some Democrats supported unilateral U.S. action on the missile violations.Democratic U.S. Senator Chris Coons, a member of the foreign relations panel who backed the Iran nuclear deal, said it was up to the Security Council to act but if it did not, the United States should, including by imposing direct sanctions on Iranians who are responsible for the missile tests.While ballistic missile tests may violate U.N. Security Council sanctions, council diplomats note that such launches are not a violation of the nuclear deal, which is focused on specific nuclear activities by Iran.Iran, which has always rejected sanctions against as illegal and unjustified, has repeatedly made clear it has no intention of complying with the restrictions on its missile program.  Asked about the panel's report, British U.N. Ambassador Matthew Rycroft told reporters it was "absolutely crucial that the Security Council upholds its responsibilities and does respond effectively to what appears to have been a breach."The expert panel did not mention a second reported missile test that Iran carried out last month. The panel produced its report after the United States, Britain, France and Germany in October called on the U.N. sanctions committee to take action in response to Iran's test of an Emad missile.Iran's U.N. mission did not respond to a request for comment. In October, Tehran disputed the Western assessment that the missile was capable of delivering a nuclear warhead.Security Council resolution 1929, which bans ballistic missile tests, was adopted in 2010 and remains valid until the nuclear deal is implemented. Under that deal, most sanctions on Iran will be lifted in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program. According to a July 20 resolution endorsing the deal, Iran is still "called upon" to refrain from work on ballistic missiles designed to deliver nuclear weapons for up to eight years.Although the section of the July 20 resolution applying to missiles is weaker and more limited than the total ban in resolution 1929, U.S. officials say they will continue to act as if there was a de facto total ban on ballistic missile tests by Iran in the years to come once the nuclear deal is implemented.The experts' report also noted that ballistic missile launches would still be covered by the July 20 resolution.U.S., Iranian and Russian officials have said they expect the full implementation of the Iran deal, including the lifting of sanctions, to happen early next year once the U.N. nuclear watchdog confirms Iranian compliance with the agreed restrictions on its atomic work.Earlier on Tuesday, the U.N. nuclear watchdog's 35-nation board in Vienna closed its investigation into whether Iran sought atomic weapons, opting to back the international deal with Tehran rather than dwell on Iran's past activities, diplomats said.U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry welcomed the decision to close the investigation into whether Iran once had a secret nuclear weapons program.

Israeli commentators used to talk about the SUV army when they spoke about ISIS, and President Obama <a href="http://www.westernjournalism.com/analysis-did-obama-succeed-to-reassure-americans-over-isis-threat-after-ca-massacre/">recently said</a> that Islamic State is a handful of people that is in the possession of “not wildly sophisticated weapons.”On Tuesday, however, alarming reports were coming in of new types of sophisticated and deadly weapons that are now in the possession of ISIS.Advertisement &#8211; story continues belowFirst. Fars News in Iran reported that Iraqi forces had <a href="http://en.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13940924000797">shot down</a> a drone that was used by Islamic State in the area west of al-Hawesh near the city of Samarra in Iraq. The Iranian news site didn&#8217;t provide more details about the downing of the drone.Then, there was a report by the British news site The Mirror about a new <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/isis-terrorists-have-built-missile-7009833">ISIS missile</a> that was capable of bringing down an airplane. The Mirror cited activists in Syria who reported that Western defectors to ISIS with experience in engineering had &#8220;managed to successfully create the devastating weapon.&#8221;Two ISIS terrorists from Denmark and Russia are said to have been behind the construction of what could be a crude crew-launched SAM rocket that can shoot down an airplane at an altitude of between 10,000 and 12,000 feet.Advertisement &#8211; story continues belowIt could be that the two ISIS engineers have cobbled together components from a launcher of the arsenals of either the Assad regime or that of Saddam Hussein in Iraq, and that the rockets were obtained in a similar way or were bought on the black market.This development could have dire consequences for civilian air traffic in the region. ISIS has already brought down a Russian civilian airplane above the Sinai desert in Egypt by detonating a crude bomb that was smuggled aboard the plane in the Egyptian resort town of Sharm al-Sheikh.Originally, experts dismissed ISIS’ claim that it had brought down the plane; but Russian and French teams that investigated the crash of the plane concluded (despite Egyptian denials) that a bomb had exploded aboard the jet after it reached an altitude of 15,000 feet. The bomb was probably detonated by remote control.The possession of SAM missiles would make it much easier for ISIS to launch terrorist attacks against civilian planes.The Mirror quoted the Syrian activist group ‘Raqqa Is Being Silently Slaughtered’ (RIBSS), which claimed that ISIS wants to carry out more sophisticated terrorist attacks on France, America and Russia.The group said it had seen the truck that carried the surface to air missile and also reported that Islamic State has installed radar in its capital of Raqqa. The rocket launcher was reportedly developed in an Iraqi weapon factory and later transferred to Raqqa in Syria, where it was connected to the local radar system, RIBSS reported.Even <a href="http://www.jerusalemonline.com/news/world-news/around-the-globe/report-turkish-citizens-supplied-isis-with-sarin-gas-17780">more terrifying news</a> about new ISIS weapons came from a member of the Turkish opposition. According to the Russian news agency RT, the high-ranking Turkish official Erem Erdem reported during an interview on Monday that ISIS had received a shipment of the deadly nerve gas Sarin. The components of the highly toxic gas reached Islamic State from Turkey and were smuggled &#8220;under the nose of the Turkish government,&#8221; Erdem told RT during the interview.“The equipment came through Turkey, and the weapon was assembled in Syria,” said Erdem. “We have incriminating evidence, we know that the material was brought through Turkey and from here was transported to the organization,” he added.Sarin gas was also <a href="http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-05-13/assad-is-said-to-be-hiding-chemical-weapons-in-syria">used</a> by the Assad regime against opponents during the four-year-old civil war. On August 21, 2013, Assad troops <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghouta_chemical_attack">used</a> the deadly chemical agent during a massive missile attack on rebel positions in Goutha, a suburb of Damascus, killing roughly 1500 people. The attack almost led to U.S. intervention in the Syrian war, but President Obama preferred a negotiated solution with Russia about the destruction of Assad’s chemical weapon stockpiles.The report about the Turkish delivery of Sarin components to ISIS has not yet been confirmed by other members of the Turkish opposition. Erem Erdem <a href="http://www.jerusalemonline.com/news/world-news/around-the-globe/report-turkish-citizens-supplied-isis-with-sarin-gas-17780">claims</a> that the Turkish government is trying to cover up the story because of possible negative consequences for the Turkish request to become a member of the European Union.<span class="ask">What do you think?</span> <span class="scroll">Scroll

It will have funding worth 322 million euros ($354 million) by 2020.Officials presented the scheme as a boost for states on Europe's Mediterranean frontier. Obligations to rescue and shelter those desperate enough to take to the sea have seen Greek and Italian coastguards and immigration services swamped by a million people this year, many fleeing civil war in Syria. The executive European Commission also wants the power to deploy EU forces without the consent of the member state concerned -- an idea that has already hit resistance in national capitals and which many see as impractical.However, frustration among northern powers, including France and Germany, at failures by Greece and Italy to document and screen masses of people arriving by boat from Turkey and Africa has driven demands for more centralized European control of the Schengen zone's external frontiers."In an area of free movement without internal borders, managing Europe’s external borders must be a shared responsibility," said Commission deputy head Frans Timmermans.Concern that the Islamic State attack on Paris last month was carried out in part by militants who had traveled along the migration route from Syria via Turkey and Greece has also increased pressure for tighter checks on the frontiers.The Commission proposal says the EU agency overseeing the frontiers should be able to "intervene immediately in crisis situations" and deploy border guards from the standby pool, drawn from other national border guard forces, within days. However, EU officials stressed that national governments would be able to block that if a majority of them were against."There is a lot of debate about us imposing our will on member states," Timmermans told reporters. "This is a safety net. Most member states would gladly accept the help.""MORE EUROPE"Migration Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos told the European Parliament in Strasbourg: "What we are creating today is more Europe." He said the proposal would "allow us to move ahead more united, more decided, more resolved".But the plan must still overcome concerns within the 28-nation EU. "The proposal means bringing in through the back door infringements on our sovereignty," said Notis Marias, a lawmaker  from Greece. "We won't go for this at all."Others argued failure to strengthen external borders would spell the end of Schengen, seen by many as one of the EU's most cherished achievements."If the external borders aren't secure, the internal borders will be raised again," said Esteban Gonzalez Pons, a Spanish conservative. "If we have common problems, we must have common answers."The current staffing of Frontex, which serves to coordinate national border agencies, is around 400. That will more than double to 1,000 by 2020. In addition, member states will have to put a total of at least 1,500 personnel on standby for deployment within days.The agency will also have a Returns Office with the task of stepping up expulsions of those who fail to qualify for asylum -- potentially hundreds of thousands of people, though many question how practical it is to detain and deport large numbers.EU proposals may briefly discuss the plans at a two-day summit starting in Brussels on Thursday. The migration crisis has drive a wedge among member states that many fear threatens the overall unity of the 28-nation bloc.The Commission also proposed legislation to increase systematic security and identity checks at the Schengen frontiers, including of EU citizens who typically pass with limited scrutiny at present.Many of those who have carried out Islamist attacks in Europe in the past two years have been EU citizens, notably French and Belgians, who have fought in Syria and gone home.

The Australian aircrew declared they were  exercising international freedom of navigation rights in audio obtained by the BBC.A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said there is 'no problem with freedom of navigation or overflight in the South China Sea' but warned countries 'outside the region' should respect the sovereignty of other states and not deliberately complicate the issue.The revelations of the Australian operation come as US Commander Admiral Scott Swift expressed concerns nations could become  increasingly tempted to use military force instead of arbitration to settle territorial  spats .'Certain countries are exaggerating tensions in the South China Sea region, which is in reality to create confusion and meddle in the South China Sea,' Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei said.Beijing is building seven man-made islands on reefs in the  Spratly Islands, including a 3000-metre-long airstrip on one of the  sites, according to satellite imagery of the area.China claims most of the South China Sea, through which more  than $US5 trillion ($A6.90 trillion) of world trade ships every  year.In October, the US guided missile destroyer Lassen sailed close  to one of China's man-made islands, drawing an angry rebuke from  China and a shadowing patrol.In a challenge to China's island building program, Manila has  asked the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague to affirm its  right to areas within 200 nautical miles of its coastline, under  the terms of a UN convention.Beijing so far has rejected the court's jurisdiction and has  boycotted the hearing. Rulings are supposed to be binding on its  member countries, which include China. But the tribunal has no  powers of enforcement and its verdicts have sometimes been ignored.Copyright Australian News Channel Pty Ltd - ABN 28068954478#########None####http://www.timesofoman.com/article/73702/World/India/Kejriwal-claimed-he-was-in-fact-the-target-and-that-Principal-Secretary-Rajendra-Kumar-was-just-an-e#############Don't Insult a King's Dog####http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/12/thailand-king-dog-lese-majeste/420621/####Give a FREE gift subscription to your friend when you start your own subscription now.Celebrate the holiday season by giving <em>The Atlantic</em> for free!As Thailand&rsquo;s junta gets aggressive with critics, one man is facing up to 37 years in jail for insulting <span>King Bhumibol Adulyadej&rsquo;s dog and &ldquo;liking&rdquo; a slanderous Facebook page about the king.</span>One of the perks of American life is the freedom to comment or speculate wildly about the pets of the head of state.

It is a religious group with carefully considered beliefs, among them that it is a key agent of the coming apocalypse. Here&rsquo;s what that means for its strategy&mdash;and for how to stop it.<span class="caps"><span class="smallcaps">What is the Islamic State</span>? </span>Where did it come from, and what are its intentions? The simplicity of these questions can be deceiving, and few Western leaders seem to know the answers. In December, <i>The New York Times</i> published confidential comments by Major General Michael K. Nagata, the Special Operations commander for the United States in the Middle East, admitting that he had hardly begun figuring out the Islamic State&#x2019;s appeal. &#x201C;We have not defeated the idea,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;We do not even understand the idea.&#x201D; In the past year, President Obama has referred to the Islamic State, variously, as &#x201C;not Islamic&#x201D; and as al-Qaeda&#x2019;s &#x201C;jayvee team,&#x201D; statements that reflected confusion about the group, and may have contributed to significant strategic errors.Victims of childhood sexual abuse are far more likely to become obese adults. New research shows that early trauma is so damaging that it can disrupt a person&rsquo;s entire psychology and metabolism.Christine White was a preteen when she went on her first diet. At school, she was bubbly and sociable, an honors student immersed in social causes. But at home, she would carefully ration her food.By the time she was 14, she had developed bulimia. It was easier to hide the purging from her family than it was to explain why she wasn&#x2019;t eating. In her darkest moments, she would scribble her anxieties into a blue-lined journal.&#x201C;<em>When I eat food now I feel guilty</em>,&#x201D; she wrote in rounded, 14-year-old script. &#x201C;<em>I don&#x2019;t like to eat in front of other people</em>.&#x201D;As a college student, she stopped throwing up but kept overeating. Carbs were her crutch. &#x201C;If I'm stressed, let me crawl inside a bag of Tostitos,&#x201D; said White, who goes by her nickname, Cissy. She would shovel handfuls of cereal in her mouth, or boil and eat enormous amounts of pasta.The debate over &lsquo;mismatch theory&rsquo; is needlessly polarized&mdash;and further research will help students, whatever the answers it generates.Last week, during oral arguments in the <em>Fisher v. University of Texas </em>affirmative action case,<em> </em>Supreme Court<em> </em>Justice Antonin Scalia drew outraged criticism for declaring that &#x201C;<span>there are those who contend that it does not benefit African&#xAD;-Americans to get them into the University of Texas where they do not do well, as opposed to having them go to a less&#xAD; advanced school, a slower&#xAD;-track school where they do well.&#x201D;</span> Scalia was clumsily alluding to &#x201C;mismatch theory,&#x201D; a prominent critique of affirmative action. Its proponents argue that non-academic preferences in college admissions ill-serve <em>some</em> intended beneficiaries, who end up admitted to schools for which they are relatively unprepared, and struggling, rather than thriving at different schools where they would be at least as well prepared as their classmates.As a new <em>Star Wars </em>series approaches, an appreciation of one of the original trilogy&rsquo;s best fringe charactersFirmus Piett&#x2019;s most memorable scene in the Star Wars<em> </em>series is the moment of his promotion. Standing silently in the background, he watches nervously as his boss, Admiral Ozzel, gets telepathically strangled by Darth Vader, the homicidal sadist everyone in the Galactic Empire has to answer to. Vader summons him forward, gives him his orders, and intones, &#x201C;You are in command now, Admiral Piett,&#x201D; as Ozzel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7O1Qd_FNgfM">collapses on the floor</a>. So goes life in the Empire: There&#x2019;s plenty of upward mobility, but job turnover is high, and workplace safety truly abysmal.Piett, played by Kenneth Colley, is a minor character in both <em>The Empire Strikes Back </em>and <em>Return of the Jedi</em>, but he has the strange distinction of being the only Imperial officer to recur in any of the Star Wars<em> </em>films (excluding Vader, who seems to occupy quite nebulous territory on the Empire org chart). After rising to command thanks to the incompetence of Admiral Ozzel, he manages to hold on to it through the end of the Empire, dying in a blaze of glory during the last space battle of the original films. To the end, he emblematizes the peculiar, banal evil of George Lucas&#x2019;s Empire: English, white, slightly stuffy, and firmly task-oriented, a functionary in a bureaucratic galaxy governed by evil space wizards. As Star Wars<em> </em>returns to theaters this week with a new entry, my wildest hope is that it can recapture that sense of the larger world Piett belonged to, and the dark humor playing out in his rise to power.<span>&ldquo;I honestly just wanted to know why the F train didn&rsquo;t have clocks. I never expected it to be so complicated.&rdquo;</span>There are people who stand every morning outside the Carroll Street station in Brooklyn staring dead-eyed into the middle distance. They stand still in ones and twos, clearly strangers to one another, mostly quiet, as though they&#x2019;d stopped on their way to work to take note of some spectacular disaster in the sky. But you look in the general direction they&#x2019;re all looking and there&#x2019;s nothing there.They are, as it turns out, waiting for the F train. Carroll Street is one of the rare New York subway stations whose trains are boarded underground but where you can stand outside to see them coming. When you spot the F rolling down the bridge, you have just enough time to run inside to catch it. So people stand there waiting. They wait for as long as it takes, for as long as their patience will allow, because in 2015 there is no app, no screen, not even a scratchy voice over a PA system that can tell them when the train is actually going to arrive.Why are so many kids with bright prospects killing themselves in Palo Alto?<i>The air shrieks, and life stops. First, from far away, comes a high whine like angry insects swarming, and then a trampling, like a herd moving through. The kids on their bikes who pass by the Caltrain crossing are eager to get home from school, but they know the drill. Brake. Wait for the train to pass. Five cars, double-decker, tearing past at 50 miles an hour. Too fast to see the faces of the Silicon Valley commuters on board, only a long silver thing with black teeth. A Caltrain coming into a station slows, invites you in.

In fact, the need for Republicans to keep control of Congress may be an obstacle the party&#x2019;s presidential nominee cannot overcome.Former Republican House Majority Leader <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/27/opinion/sunday/eric-cantor-the-gop-after-john-boehner.html?_r=0">Eric Cantor</a> has complained that his party has been very unrealistic in its expectations of what it could accomplish, legislatively, with just control of Congress, given the president&#x2019;s veto power. Overriding a veto would require a larger majority than Republicans have in either the House of Representatives or Senate, even without the filibuster.Corporal punishment is legal in 19 states.<span><span>&#x201C;But I wasn&#x2019;t chewing any gum,&#x201D; the 10-year-old begged, insisting he was innocent. </span></span><span><span>&#x201C;You&#x2019;re a liar!&#x201D; the adult reportedly responded. &#x201C;Now you&#x2019;re really going to get it because you keep lying to me.&#x201D; </span></span><span><span>In the name of emotional well-being, college students are increasingly demanding protection from words and ideas they don&rsquo;t like.

A movement is arising, undirected and driven largely by students, to scrub campuses clean of words, ideas, and subjects that might cause discomfort or give offense. Last December, Jeannie Suk wrote in an online article for <i>The New Yorker</i> about law students asking her fellow professors at Harvard not to teach rape law&#x2014;or, in one case, even use the word <i>violate</i> (as in &#x201C;that violates the law&#x201D;) lest it cause students distress. In February, Laura Kipnis, a professor at Northwestern University, wrote an essay in <i>The Chronicle of Higher Education </i>describing a new campus politics of sexual paranoia&#x2014;and was then subjected to a long investigation after students who were offended by the article and by a tweet she&#x2019;d sent filed Title IX complaints against her. In June, a professor protecting himself with a pseudonym wrote an essay for Vox describing how gingerly he now has to teach. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m a Liberal Professor, and My Liberal Students Terrify Me,&#x201D; the headline said. A number of popular comedians, including Chris Rock, have stopped performing on college campuses (see Caitlin Flanagan&#x2019;s <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/09/thats-not-funny/399335/">article</a> in this month&#x2019;s issue).

Eritrea, Ethiopia and Turkey also figured prominently on the list.The report released early Tuesday says a quarter of the 199 journalists worldwide who were in prison as of Dec. 1 because of their work were in China. The Communist Party-run country under President Xi Jinping had 49 journalists behind bars, the highest number for China since the CPJ began its annual survey in 1990.The report also singled out three jailed Chinese who were not included on its annual list: the three brothers of a U.S.-based journalist with Radio Free Asia who covers China's treatment of his ethnic group, the Muslim Uighurs. CPJ calls the jailing of Shohret Hoshur's brothers an act of retaliation for his reporting and an example of "the lengths to which China is willing to go to silence its critics."Egypt was second on the list with 23 journalists in prison, up from a dozen a year ago and zero in 2012."Perhaps nowhere has the climate for the press deteriorated more rapidly than in Egypt," the report says, accusing President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi of acting under the pretext of national security since he took office in 2014 a year after the military ousted Islamist President Mohammed Morsi. In August, el-Sissi approved a law that included heavy fines for journalists who don't follow the government line.Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian is among the 19 journalists that the CPJ lists as being behind bars in Iran, an Islamic republic under Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Hassan Rouhani.&nbsp;The new report calls the east African country of Eritrea "the world's worst abuser of due process," as no CPJ-listed journalist detained under long-time President Isaias Afwerki has ever been publicly charged with a crime or taken to court for trial. Seventeen journalists are currently behind bars there.The report expresses special concern about Turkey, where the number of jailed journalists doubled over the past year to 14. Late last month, hundreds of protesters chanted "Free press cannot be silenced" after journalists Can Dundar and Erdem Gul were jailed on terror and espionage charges for their reports on alleged Turkish arms smuggling to Syria. The journalists were investigated after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan filed a criminal complaint.And in August, authorities detained three journalists reporting for Vice News in Turkey's restive Kurdish southeast. One of them, Mohammed Rasool, is still in custody. Rasool, an Iraqi citizen, had worked as a news assistant for the AP and other media organizations.&nbsp;Ethiopia, under Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn, has 10 journalists behind bars. At the time of President Barack Obama's visit to Ethiopia in July, Desalegn defended his government's commitment to democracy and said the country needs "ethical journalism," not reporters that "pass the line."The report says other countries with several journalists behind bars in 2015 include Azerbaijan with eight, Saudi Arabia and Syria with seven each, Vietnam with six, and Bahrain, Bangladesh and Myanmar with five apiece.The CPJ report does not list journalists who are held by non-state groups such as the Islamic State but estimates that at least 40 journalists are missing in the Middle East and North Africa, with many thought to be held by militant groups.A separate report released Tuesday by the Paris-based Reporters Without Borders lists 153 journalists currently imprisoned around the world, along with 161 "citizen journalists." The report also says 54 journalists are currently being held hostage around the world, with the Islamic State group holding 18 in Syria and Iraq and the Houthi rebel group in Yemen holding nine.<em><strong>&nbsp;Also on HuffPost:</strong></em>#########Cameron's 'Brexit' riddle: Row with EU or row with Eurosceptics?####http://in.reuters.com/article/britain-eu-cameron-idINKBN0TY28720151215####<span class="articleLocation">LONDON</span> When David Cameron urges European Union leaders on Thursday to do a deal to keep Britain in the bloc, he will face a riddle that has haunted Conservative prime ministers for three decades: a row with Europe or a row with Eurosceptics at home?Cameron's bid to renegotiate the terms of Britain's membership of the bloc ahead of a referendum he has promised by the end of 2017, has hit the rocks over a demand to make working EU migrants wait four years before getting some benefits.EU partners call that measure impossible while Conservative opponents of membership have pounced on hints that he may drop it as evidence that the renegotiation is a choreographed sham that will end in a fudged deal early next year."If the prime minister is not able to persuade the EU nation states to give us the four-year wait on migrant benefits then it really will be trivial," Steve Baker, a Conservative lawmaker who is campaigning for a British exit, told Reuters."My expectation is that by the time we get to February something will be offered which will be presented as a great success, but that it will still be inconsequential."Baker said he has 136 Conservative lawmakers on his mailing list, indicating that more than a third of Cameron's 331-strong parliamentary party may be toying with the idea of a 'Brexit'.Senior Conservative Eurosceptics are waiting to see the final results of Cameron's high wire act before making their views explicit, though Defence Secretary Michael Fallon quipped in October that "We're all Eurosceptics now".Pro-Europeans fear Cameron could edge Britain towards an accidental Brexit if he overplays his hand in talks to appease sceptics in his party and senior Conservatives who are jockeying for a battle to succeed him due before 2020.A British exit would rock the Union - already shaken by differences over migration and the future of the euro zone - by ripping away its second-largest economy, one of its top two military powers and by far its richest city, London.An exit from the EU could also trigger the break-up of the United Kingdom by prompting another Scottish independence vote. The $2.9 trillion British economy would face years of uncertain negotiations over the terms of a divorce.Cameron says he will recommend Britain stays in the EU if he gets what he wants but has repeatedly warned that he rules nothing out if he doesn't - code for campaigning to leave, a step that would make Brexit highly likely.The timing of the referendum is uncertain but Cameron has said he would prefer it as soon as possible. If he gets a deal in February, as European Council President Donald Tusk has said is possible, the vote could be as early as June."BASTARDS"Opponents of EU membership say that if it took back full sovereignty, Britain could prosper as a global trading centre outside a bloc they say has slipped far behind rivals.Opinion polls show British voters are evenly split over membership, with a significant number of people who have yet to makeup their mind, though perceptions that the EU has failed to deal with the migrant crisis may be turning some towards a Brexit.Europe has divided the Conservative Party for three decades and played a major part in the downfall of two of Cameron's two Conservative predecessors, Margaret Thatcher and John Major.Major, prime minister from 1990 to 1997, was undermined by Eurosceptic Conservatives whom he famously called "bastards". Cameron has a majority of 16 in parliament, smaller than Major's after the 1992 election.The EU inflames such passions that Cameron warned in 2006 that the party had to stop "banging on" about Europe.But less than seven years later, under pressure from lawmakers who feared the electoral success of the anti-EU UK Independence Party, Cameron promised a referendum on membership.So far his renegotiation has failed to impress Conservative Eurosceptics who believe the leaders of the euro zone must forge a much deeper political union to save the euro."I just don't think its realistic for Britain to carry on with a small fix when the European Union is so obviously transforming itself in a very dramatic way towards political union," John Redwood, a Eurosceptic Conservative lawmaker, said of the renegotiation.Redwood added that Cameron knew many Conservative lawmakers wanted a complete re-write of EU treaties and that if that was not possible then "we need to leave the treaties".Cameron has demanded a promise than any deal he gets would be enshrined in a future EU treaty."MANUFACTURING A ROW"Up to a third of Cameron's cabinet - including Home Secretary Theresa May, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, Business Secretary Sajid Javid and Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith - have expressed Eurosceptic sentiments."Will they all campaign openly for 'leave' if Cameron is arguing for 'stay'?" asked Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London and author of "The Conservative Party: From Thatcher to Cameron"."Cameron's room for manoeuvre in cabinet really depends on him: if he thinks he can afford to lose a few people, then he can take a stronger line; if he thinks there's too many of them and that a mass walkout would damage the government's wider credibility, then his options are more limited."Cameron is demanding guarantees to ensure London's financial dominance is not impeded by the closer integration of the euro zone, and he wants a commitment that the goal of ever closer union in the EU treaty's preamble will not to apply to Britain."What David Cameron is asking for is trivial," said Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Vote Leave which is campaigning to leave the bloc that Britain joined in 1973."He knows that unless he can declare victory in February, many of his MPs and party members will be unlikely to back him in the referendum. That's why he is now manufacturing a row to make himself look tough," he told Reuters.Cameron is likely to eventually secure agreement on most of his demands, including a call for better regulation and more open markets to promote growth, though no deal is yet drafted, partly due to the deadlock over in-work benefits.His manifesto pledge to introduce a four-year residency rule for migrants seeking tax credits and social housing has created the most concern because it would discriminate among EU citizens and hence breach EU law and precedent.Official statistics show EU migrants contribute far more to British public coffers than they get back.But if Cameron is unable to achieve changes to the EU's freedom of movement rules, Britons will vote to leave the bloc, according to an ICM poll published on Tuesday.The prime minister says voters are so concerned by immigration that he needs a way to restore "fairness" to the system if he is to recommend staying in, though he said last month that he is "open to different ways of dealing with this issue".When reports surfaced in British media that Cameron would drop his demand over in-work benefits after it got a frosty reception in Romania and Poland last week, his office denied the reports and British ministers insisted the demand stood in the absence of a counter-proposal from the EU.One cartoon in The Times newspaper showed Cameron trying to smash down an EU door with demands before eventually relenting in exhaustion and then knocking politely with a tray of wine. The door opened."Cameron has painted himself into a corner when it comes to in-work benefits for EU migrants: it was a bone he threw to his sceptics without thinking it through," said Bale."But having promised it, he's going to have to deliver something. The problem is whatever he gets now could end up looking worse than nothing at all," he added.

He is the first of six officers to stand trial on charges stemming from Gray's death in April.The jury has also sent out notes asking for water, highlighters, sticky notes and paper. They also requested the clerk's list of exhibits in evidence, which the judge denied.Williams ordered the panel to continue deliberating, which they did until early evening. Deliberations will continue at 9 a.m. Wednesday.Gray died April 19, a week after his neck was broken in the back of a police van with his wrists and ankles shackled. Porter is charged with manslaughter, assault, reckless endangerment and misconduct. He faces up to 25 years in prison.Gray's death set of riots around Baltimore, and highlighted a police department that many citizens say is abusive. As a result, many local officials feel the outcome of Porter's trial could touch off unrest again.<a href="http://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2015/12/15/baltimore-jury-mulls-officers-fate-in-freddie-grays-death/" target="_blank">CBS affiliate WJZ reported</a> defense attorneys asked for a mistrial and change of venue Tuesday morning because of a letter sent by Baltimore City schools. In it, the city schools CEO said he was very concerned about possible city unrest. Defense attorneys said some jurors may have gotten it because they are parents and it could influence their decision. The judge denied the motions, saying he wasn't concerned about that.Armored vehicles and police are being stationed around the city ahead of any verdict from the jury in the trial. Baltimore County Public School spokesman Mychael Dickerson said Tuesday that the school system is postponing, and in some cases canceling, field trips and events in Baltimore city through Friday. The county surrounds most of the city and extends north to Maryland's border with Pennsylvania.Prosecutors described Officer William Porter as indifferent to Gray's safety, repeatedly denying him medical care in the police wagon where his neck was broken after he was left handcuffed and shackled but unbuckled on the floor of the van, vulnerable to a serious injury if the brakes were slammed.The wagon "became his casket on wheels" after Porter failed to belt him to the bench or call for a medic after he was injured, prosecutor Janice Bledsoe said in her closing arguments. Gray was arrested about seven city blocks from the station, and yet police stopped the van repeatedly and the trip became a 45-minute journey."With great power comes great responsibility," Bledsoe said. "Porter had the opportunity on four or five occasions to wield his power to save Freddie Gray. He abused his power. He failed his responsibility."Defense attorney Joseph Murtha countered that nothing more than conjecture and speculation implicates his client.Gray's death was a "horrific tragedy," Murtha said, but "there is literally no evidence" that Porter caused it."The absence of real evidence raises much more than reasonable doubt," Murtha told jurors.

There are reports the security forces may have executed some of those arrested.&ldquo;With this latest series of bloody events, the country seems to have taken a new step toward outright civil war, and tensions are now at bursting point in Bujumbura,&quot; said Pouilly.After years of peace, Burundi took a deadly turn in April, when President Pierre Nkurunziza announced plans to run for a third term, which critics consider unconstitutional. The violent protests that erupted have waxed and waned but have lately increased.The U.N. refugee agency says more than 220,000 Burundians have taken refuge in neighboring countries this year.Pouilly tells VOA that security in Bujumbura is very difficult and U.N. monitors have not been able to get accurate figures on what happened Friday.&ldquo;The government, the authorities say that the number of attackers who were involved in Friday&rsquo;s bloody events were 150 people and that 79 of them were killed. Some people are saying that the number of civilian casualties could be as high as 200.&nbsp; But, we really have no way of confirming these allegations of these figures,&quot; she said.High Commissioner Zeid is urging all parties to do all they can to stop the violence.&nbsp; He appeals to the government and opponents to engage in a meaningful and inclusive dialogue.Thursday, the U.N. Human Rights Council will hold a special session on Burundi in an effort to clarify events and prevent the situation from escalating. #########None####http://www.forbes.com/sites/stephenharner/2015/12/15/on-cheap-financing-and-great-technology-japan-shinkansen-wins-in-india-watch-china-next/#############U.N. Bases Turn Into Cities For Desperate And Displaced In South Sudan####http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2015/12/15/459816270/u-n-bases-turn-into-cities-for-the-desperate-and-displaced-in-s-sudan####NPR Newscast4min 45sec<a class="program" href="http://www.npr.org/programs/all-things-considered/">All Things Considered</a>South Sudanese seeking refuge line up to register at the U.N.'s base in Bentiu in February. At that time, the camp was receiving up to 200 new people a day. It now serves as home to some 100,000 people.Two years ago today, thousands of desperate South Sudanese came rushing to the gates of United Nations peacekeeper bases in the country, fleeing villages torn by ethnic conflict and begging for sanctuary.The civil war, which started when a political rivalry between South Sudan's president and his former deputy spiraled into ethnic conflict, took the U.N. Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) by surprise. Their military bases were not equipped to shelter thousands of displaced people.But with surprising rapidity, UNMISS leadership came to a decision. They decided to do in South Sudan what they had not done in 1994 during the genocide in Rwanda, when civilians were left outside to die.This time, they would offer protection. They boldly opened their gates, saving hundreds of thousands of lives.Peacekeeping soldiers quickly got to work digging latrines and building levees against the fierce rains. Bentiu, a camp in the north of the country, was built on a swamp. Women in the camp stood all night in waist-deep water holding their children so they wouldn't drown while sleeping. Malaria was endemic.Today, the Bentiu camp is transformed. Walking around the smooth dirt streets, it feels like an orderly frontier city, like something out of a Western movie set. More than 100,000 people who live here have schools, churches and clinics provided by aid organizations.It's the biggest city in 100 miles, except it's not a city. It's a temporary camp that is supposed to start dismantling whenever real peace arrives.Parts of the Bentiu camp were once so flooded, women had to hold their children aloft all night during the fierce rains to prevent them from drowning. Now, the banks are built and the area is ready for new corrugated tin houses to be built.There are dozens of U.N. bases turned refugee camps like this across South Sudan. They're called "protection of civilian sites" (PoCs), and their population has only increased as people continue to flee fighting and conflict-related hunger.Talk to anyone here, and they will say they owe their lives to the concrete walls guarded by U.N. peacekeepers from India, Moldova and Rwanda.But protecting civilians has not come without cost. A<a href="http://www.refugee-rights.org/Publications/Papers/2015/ProtectingSomeofthePeopleFINAL.pdf"> study of PoCs</a> released Tuesday by the Uganda-based International Refugee Rights Initiative says that while the U.N. did the right thing in opening the gates, the hard walls also enforce ethnic divisions.The survey looked at perceptions of UNMISS both inside and outside the camps. It found that people outside largely see the PoCs as places of danger, harboring combatants who laid down their arms as they entered."Camps that are a place of safety for some," lead author Lucy Hovil says, "are seen as a place of danger for others."She says that association has made it harder for people inside the camps, especially young men, to leave."Some people said to us, 'Well, if we go home now, and they [ask us] where have you been for two years and we say the PoC site, they will associate us with having been part of the conflict itself,' " she says.That conflict still simmers, despite a peace agreement signed in August. Meanwhile, government officials and rebel leaders have fueled distrust with divisive rhetoric.Hovil says that's a Catch-22 of the U.N. role: The concrete walls that keep civilians safe also allow the spread of rumor and resentments on both sides. And they inhibit natural communication and social interaction between rival ethnic groups. Government officials have come on the radio to say that anyone refusing to leave the camps is a rebel sympathizer.UNMISS, she says, "lacks a good public relations strategy" to combat this.In a primary school in the Bentiu camp, I meet Simon Tut Kuol, the 29-year-old headmaster. He lists all the things his students don't have, like chairs and textbooks.I ask him if he thinks the kids know why that is. Do they ask who took their chairs and textbooks away before they were forced to move to the camp?"Yes, we know them!" Kuol exclaims. "It is the soldiers — the government that destroyed all those things."The government is associated with one ethnic group, the Dinka. This camp primarily harbors another, the Nuer.But Kuol insists that he tries to shield the students from ethnic hatred. In one fifth grade class, the kids were belting out an anthem from South Sudan's independence in 2011: "This is our land. This is our motherland."Kuol shakes his head. He tells me he wishes that government officials could come and hear this song of unity — if any of them would dare set foot inside this camp.Please keep your community civil.

Scientists have questioned whether swinging our arms actually benefits the way we move, and some studies have concluded that arm swinging in runners helps to maintain balance and <a href="http://www.livescience.com/46844-natural-arm-swing-saves-runners-energy.html">conserve energy</a>.But swinging only one arm is unusual, said Bastiaan R. Bloem, a co-author of the new study and professor of movement disorders neurology at Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre in the Netherlands. In fact, an immobile arm is one of the earliest known indicators of Parkinson's disease, he said.After a colleague sent Bloem an email about a YouTube video showing Putin's stiff right arm, Bloem was intrigued enough to dig a little deeper, he told Live Science. He found a number of videos showing Putin at public events where he walked for long distances. The lack of arm movement had persisted across years."You could say, if it were one occasion, maybe he just had a painful shoulder or some other intermittent problem," Bloem said. "But then we discovered this was a consistent finding stretching out over a period of multiple years."Bloem and a number of his colleagues practice a subdiscipline of neurology that identifies them as "movement disorder enthusiasts." As the term suggests, analyzing how people walk is second nature to these specialists &mdash; at neurology conferences, they're the ones evaluating how everyone else ambles across the room."Normal movements are complex, and then seeing how they go wrong, when there are defects in the brain, is a fascinating area," Bloem said.Footage of Putin's walk intrigued Bloem and the study co-authors. But it didn't take long for them to rule out<a href="http://www.livescience.com/53042-pesticide-milk-linked-parkinsons-disease.html">Parkinson's</a> as a cause for Putin's unusual gait. Parkinson's is a progressive disease, and in footage separated by years, there was no evidence that the movement of Putin's arm, or of any other part of his body, was getting progressively worse.In fact, all evidence seemed to indicate that overall, Putin is in fine physical shape. The researchers evaluated footage of Putin performing a number of different activities, and pronounced his motor skills "excellent."It was then that Bloem discovered that Putin wasn't the only Russian official walking this way.The researchers observed similar walking patterns &mdash; a stiff, nearly immobile right arm accompanying otherwise normal movement &mdash; in four other prominent Russian officials: Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev; former Minister of Defense Anatoly Serdyukov; Sergei Ivanov, chief of the presidential administration of Russia; and Commander of the Western Military District Anatoly Sidarov.Other footage and photographs that the scientists examined showed that the Russian officials were all right-handed and did not appear to suffer from any impairment of their right arms, except as exhibited while they were walking.That, Bloem told Live Science, was when things became "really peculiar."The odds of all five Russian officials suffering from Parkinson's and exhibiting precisely the same symptoms that appeared on the same side of the body and at the same stage of degeneration were slim. Bloem and his colleagues knew there had to be another explanation, and they found it &mdash; not in medical literature, but in the pages of a KGB training manual.&nbsp;"It literally says, when you're walking, don't move the right arm, keep it close to the holster and be ready to <a href="http://www.livescience.com/6041-reactions-faster-actions-study-finds.html">draw the gun</a>," Bloem described.Putin and Ivanov both served in the KGB, where they would have doubtless been trained "by the book," to restrict their right arm movements while walking. And although the other officials were not KGB, their military backgrounds could explain their adopting this particular gait.For Medvedev, the only official with neither KGB nor military training, the study suggests that his reduced arm swing could be an example of "imitating the boss," a practice not uncommon in Russia, where officials frequently absorb mannerisms of their superiors, according to the researchers.The study authors found more examples of this weapon-ready walk in another unlikely location &mdash; Hollywood movies about rough-and-ready "wild west" gunfighters. Like the Russian officials, actors portraying gunslingers in <a href="http://www.livescience.com/43999-physics-lasso-trick-roping.html">old-time westerns</a> displayed a similarly immobile right arm when they strode down Main Street at high noon.The researchers concluded that although Putin's movements appear to be the result of conditioning, and not an example of a neurological disorder, the study is still valuable to those who study diseases like <a href="http://www.livescience.com/50913-depression-linked-with-parkinsons-disease.html">Parkinson's</a>, Bloem said. By drawing attention to this trait as a symptom of Parkinson's, the new study could help doctors identify Parkinson's earlier, and prevent the full-blown disease from developing.And reporting it with a touch of whimsy doesn't hurt either, Bloem added."It's a tongue-in-cheek, semi-funny paper, but there's a very serious message behind it as well," Bloem said. "Teaching moments tend to stick best if they're presented in a humorous way."<em>Follow Mindy Weisberger on </em><em><a href="https://twitter.com/LaMinda">Twitter</a>&nbsp;</em><em>and Google+.</em><em>&nbsp;Follow us </em><a href="https://twitter.com/LiveScience"><em>@livescience</em></a><em>, </em><a href="http://www.facebook.com/#!/livescience"><em>Facebook</em></a><em>&nbsp;&amp; </em><a href="https://plus.google.com/101164570444913213957/posts"><em>Google+</em></a><em>.
