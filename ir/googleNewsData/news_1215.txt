####Kerry seeks 'real progress' on Syria in Moscow talks####http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-russia-usa-idUSKBN0TX23O20151215####<span class="articleLocation">MOSCOW</span> U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry sought in a visit to Moscow on Tuesday to make progress in narrowing differences with Russian leader Vladimir Putin over how to end the conflict in Syria.At the start of a three-hour meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Kerry said he wanted to prepare the ground for a third round of talks of world powers on Syria, which is penciled in for Friday in New York.  It was unclear whether the meeting would go ahead without progress between Russia and the United States over the role of  Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in any political transition and over which rebel groups should be part of peace talks.Both these issues would be discussed with Putin at the Kremlin later in the day."I look forward to making real progress," Kerry said before his meeting with Lavrov, which was followed by a lunch."I think the world benefits when powerful nations with a long history with each other have the ability to be able to find common ground," he added.Kerry told Lavrov: "Even when there have been differences between us we have been able to work effectively on specific issues."Russia, one of Assad's staunchest allies, has launched a campaign of air strikes that it said targeted Islamic State militants but which also supported Assad's forces. The Kremlin  says the Syrian people, and not external powers, should decide Assad's political fate.Lavrov told Kerry there was a need for more effective international cooperation in fighting terror. "On that route there are still questions which today we need to look at," Lavrov said in his opening remarks.Kerry described the talks with Lavrov as "good" as he took a break to stroll in a shopping area near the residence of the U.S. ambassador to Moscow where he was mobbed by a crowd who wanted a glimpse of him.Asked whether the New York meeting would happen, Kerry said: "I need to meet with the president (Putin). I look forward to that. It will be an important meeting."The run-up to the Moscow talks underlined the distance between Moscow and Washington on how to deal with the Syria crisis.For its part, the Russian Foreign Ministry issued a statement complaining that Washington was not ready to fully cooperate in the struggle against Islamic State militants and needed to rethink its policy of "dividing terrorists into good and bad ones".Kerry's visit follows a meeting last week in Riyadh which agreed to unite a number of opposition groups, not including Islamic State, to negotiate with Damascus in peace talks.U.S. officials expect the talks with Putin would be dominated by the list of opposition groups that would join the talks.Kremlin spokesman Dimitry Peskov said it was good in principle that the opposition forces were coming together but he said the devil was in the details."We need to understand who precisely has joined this coalition, and what aims they are declaring," he said.NO DEAL ON UKRAINEKerry's talks with Putin will also delve deeper into details of a planned Jan. 1 ceasefire in Syria, as well as Monday's comments by Russia on supporting the Free Syrian Army (FSA), which has been fighting Russian- and Iranian-backed government forces.Russia has given mixed messages on the FSA. News agencies on Monday quoted Valery Gerasimov, the chief of the Russian army's general staff, as saying his country was providing it with weapons, ammunition and material support, while a top Kremlin aide later said there was no such arrangement.FSA rebels fighting Assad's forces in western Syria denied receiving any support from the Russian air force, saying on the contrary it continued to bomb them.Kerry will also underscore the importance of implementing the Minsk peace accords on Ukraine and plans for free and fair elections in eastern Ukraine.

Seven assailants died in that attack and an eighth in police raids days later, but police are still searching for another chief suspect, Salah Abdeslam, who vanished after escaping to Belgium from Paris.  Another man and a woman arrested by police on Tuesday were suspected of supplying weapons to Amedy Coulibaly, who killed a policewoman and then four other people at the kosher store on the eastern edge of Paris last January, they said.That attack took place on the heels of another in which two Islamist militants killed 12 people at the offices of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, which became a target after publishing mocking cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad.

It has a waistbelt and shoulder straps. That has to provide quite a bit of downforce to get my body onto the treadmill so after about 40 minutes, that gets very uncomfortable," Peake said in a <a href="http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Human_Spaceflight/Principia/Tim_Peake_to_run_London_marathon_from_space" target="_blank">press release</a> from the ESA.

For reference, it takes longer to fly from New York to San Francisco than it does for a Soyuz to get to the Space Station — located 250 miles above Earth — using this expedited flight profile. (Live coverage of the Soyuz’s arrival will start at 11:45 a.m. ET.) Once on the station, the three crewmembers will join NASA's Scott Kelly and cosmonauts Mikhail Kornienko and Sergey Volkov onboard the space lab. Kelly and Kornienko are both taking part in the station's first one-year mission and are expected to return to Earth in March 2016.At the moment, NASA and other space agencies depend on Russia’s Soyuz spacecraft and rockets to get to the station, but that could change by 2017 when two private spaceflight companies — Boeing and <a href="http://mashable.com/2015/05/06/spacex-crew-dragon-test/" data-crackerjax="#post-slider">SpaceX</a> — are expected to start flying astronauts to the orbiting lab under a contract with NASA.#########A Thai Man Faces Nearly 40 Years in Jail for Insulting the King's Dog####http://time.com/4148911/thailand-bhumibol-tongdaeng-lese-majeste/####A Thai man faces up to 37 years in prison for mocking the king&#8217;s dog over <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/15/world/asia/thailand-lese-majeste-tongdaeng.html?_r=0">social media</a>, an apparent violation of Thailand&#8217;s stringent laws against insults aimed at the country&#8217;s monarchy.Authorities arrested factory worker Thanakorn Siripaiboon at his home in suburban Bangkok last week and charged him with writing a &#8220;sarcastic&#8221; Internet post about Tongdaeng, the mongrel owned by King Bhumibol Adulyadej, as well as with sedition and insulting the King, reports the New York <em>Time</em>s.The Thai military, which seized control of the country in a coup last year, did not specify the exact insult Thanakorn used.Tongdaeng, whose name means <em>copper</em>, is beloved in Thailand, the <em>Times</em> reports. Last week, <a href="http://www.afp.com/en/news/thai-kings-dog-spells-box-office-magic">the No. 2 film</a> at Thai box offices was <em>Khun Tongdaeng: The Inspirations</em>, an animated picture inspired by a book King Bhumibol wrote in 2002 about his pet.Thanakorn&#8217;s case is the latest concerning a breach of Thailand&#8217;s controversial l&egrave;se majest&eacute; laws &mdash; the scope of which, experts say, has broadened considerably in recent years. Last December, two Thai students in their 20s <a href="http://time.com/3650981/thailand-lese-majeste-article-112/">pleaded guilty</a> to insulting the monarchy after staging a play about a fictitious king.Journalists on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/zenjournalist/status/676636457902018560">noted</a> that the <em>Times </em>report on the charges against Thanakorn did not appear in editions of the newspaper printed and sold in Thailand.

Carter on Tuesday visited a Turkish air base near the Syrian border that has become a hub for operations against the Islamic State, as the Obama administration presses Turkey and other allied nations to step up their military response to the extremist group. Carter touched down at Incirlik, located in southern Turkey about 100 miles from the Syrian border, at the beginning of a Middle Eastern tour that will give him a chance to assess the evolving U.S. campaign against the militant group that, despite 16 months of U.S. and allied airstrikes, remains dug in across large tracts of Syria and Iraq. The visit comes a day after President Obama convened an unusual meeting of top national security officials at the Pentagon to examine plans for battling the Islamic State, a radical al-Qaeda offshoot also known as ISIS and ISIL. In the wake of terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif., Obama has sought to reassure Americans about his strategy for containing the group overseas and for preventing attacks at home. While U.S.-backed forces in both countries have made progress in dislodging Islamic State fighters from some areas, satellite groups have gained momentum in places such as Libya and Egypt, illustrating the challenge of containing loosely linked militant organizations that share the same ideology and tactics.Speaking to reporters en route to Turkey, Carter said Obama has tasked his national security advisers to “identify and carry out every conceivable way of accelerating the defeat of ISIL.”In recent weeks, the Obama administration has rolled out a series of new steps designed to make its military campaign more effective, including establishing a new Special Operations task force in Iraq and sending a small number of elite U.S. troops into Syria.  <i>[<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/russian-airstrikes-force-a-halt-to-aid-in-syria-triggering-a-new-crisis/2015/12/14/cebc4b66-9f87-11e5-9ad2-568d814bbf3b_story.html?hpid=hp_rhp-top-table-main_syriacrisis10p%3Ahomepage%2Fstory">Russian airstrikes paralyze aid operations in Syria</a>]</i> Some European nations have already stepped up their military campaigns following the Nov. 13 Paris attacks. France has intensified its airstrikes in Syria, and British warplanes are now bombing militant positions there. But Obama administration officials are plainly dissatisfied with the commitments of other coalition nations, including Arab countries of the Persian Gulf that have been focused in recent months on the conflict in Yemen. Carter said he had made suggestions about the kind of additional commitments that those countries could make but is hoping their leaders will be “creative” when considering additional steps. While Carter is not expected to meet with Turkish leaders during his brief visit, he said the United States was also asking Turkey to expand its role in countering the Islamic State.“The single most important contribution that their geography makes necessary is the control of their own border,” Carter said. The Islamic State and other armed groups have long used Turkey’s southern border to smuggle contraband and fighters in and out of Syria.As Ankara and Washington seek common ground in grappling with the shared Islamic State threat, they must also manage the differences in their approaches to Syria’s civil war. Turkey, eager to see the departure of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and to keep Kurdish ambitions in check, has pushed for more aggressive U.S. actions in Syria, including a no-fly zone. The United States meanwhile has pressed Turkey to close off resupply routes used by the Islamic State and, more recently, has sought to defuse Turkish-Russian tensions over Moscow’s air campaign in Syria. It was Carter’s first visit as defense secretary to Incirlik, where U.S. aircraft began launching strike missions this summer. The base now hosts a growing air fleet from four countries: Turkey, the United States, Qatar and Germany. About 45 of the 59 manned and unmanned aircraft stationed there are American, U.S. officials say. Carter was scheduled to meet with U.S. troops at Incirlik and in visits to other countries in the region. worldnational-security<i class="fa fa-check checked-icon"></i> <span>Success!</span> Check your inbox for details. <span class="might-like"> You might also like:</span> Please enter a valid email address <a href="https://subscribe.washingtonpost.com/newsletters">See all newsletters</a> SuperFan BadgeSuperFan badge holders consistently post smart, timely comments about Washington area sports and teams.<a target="_badgeinfo" href="//www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/interactivity/get-a-badge.html">More about badges</a> | <a target="_badgeinfo" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/interactivity/get-a-badge.html">Request a badge</a>Culture Connoisseur BadgeCulture Connoisseurs consistently offer thought-provoking, timely comments on the arts, lifestyle and entertainment.<a target="_badgeinfo" href="//www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/interactivity/get-a-badge.html">More about badges</a> | <a target="_badgeinfo" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/interactivity/get-a-badge.html">Request a badge</a>Fact Checker BadgeFact Checkers contribute questions, information and facts to <a target="_badgeinfo" href="//www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker">The Fact Checker</a>.<a target="_badgeinfo" href="//www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/interactivity/get-a-badge.html">More about badges</a> | <a target="_badgeinfo" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/interactivity/get-a-badge.html">Request a badge</a>Washingtologist BadgeWashingtologists consistently post thought-provoking, timely comments on events, communities, and trends in the Washington area.<a target="_badgeinfo" href="//www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/interactivity/get-a-badge.html">More about badges</a> | <a target="_badgeinfo" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/interactivity/get-a-badge.html">Request a badge</a>Post Writer BadgeThis commenter is a Washington Post editor, reporter or producer.Post Forum BadgePost Forum members consistently offer thought-provoking, timely comments on politics, national and international affairs.<a target="_badgeinfo" href="//www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/interactivity/get-a-badge.html">More about badges</a> | <a target="_badgeinfo" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/interactivity/get-a-badge.html">Request a badge</a>Weather Watcher BadgeWeather Watchers consistently offer thought-provoking, timely comments on climates and forecasts.<a target="_badgeinfo" href="//www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/interactivity/get-a-badge.html">More about badges</a> | <a target="_badgeinfo" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/interactivity/get-a-badge.html">Request a badge</a>World Watcher BadgeWorld Watchers consistently offer thought-provoking, timely comments on international affairs.<a target="_badgeinfo" href="//www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/interactivity/get-a-badge.html">More about badges</a> | <a target="_badgeinfo" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/interactivity/get-a-badge.html">Request a badge</a>Post Contributor BadgeThis commenter is a Washington Post contributor.

PTIIn July this year, the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) forwarded a charge of corruption against Rajendra Kumar, Kejriwal’s principal secretary, to the CBI.It is alleged that Kumar had benefitted one company in the tender process for purchasing of computers. Kumar is also alleged to have formed benami companies to allot government work and appointed his relatives as directors in many of these firms.Following 14 raids in different locations including Rajendra Kumar’s office in Delhi secretariat on Tuesday morning, CBI sources said Rs 13 lakh cash and foreign currency worth Rs 3 lakh have been recovered from Kumar and also from another person. It said Rs 2.4 lakh was found from Kumar’s residence along with papers of three immovable properties.It is to be noted here that Kumar, a 1989 batch IAS officer, was appointed principal secretary to Kejriwal in February when AAP came to power for the second time. He was also secretary to Kejriwal during his previous 49-day stint as chief minister.It is incredible to suggest, therefore, that Kejriwal was completely in the dark about serious charges of corruption against his favourite babu, both of whom go back a long way.Going by the crusader-against-corruption image that Kejriwal is so fond of projecting, this would have been a marvelous opportunity for the Delhi chief minister to show that he walks the talk on graft. In one fell swoop, Kejriwal would have silenced his critics who accuse him of giving birth to a stillborn Lokpal Bill that makes a mockery of the original Bill which he fought for in 2011 and even the one over which he once ended up resigning as Delhi chief minister.Unfortunately, Kejriwal seems to be so taken in the by the shadow-boxing against favourite enemy <a href="http://www.firstpost.com/topic/person/narendra-modi-profile-20711.html" title="Narendra Modi" target="_blank" class="auto-link" >Narendra Modi</a> that not only has he lost the opportunity to redeem his image, he has exposed himself as a politician who despite holding a high office, is callous with facts.Asking a rhetorical question five hours after he dramatically posted on Twitter that “CBI is raiding my office”, he fired another 140-character missile: “My question -had Rajender not been my secretary, then wud he have been raided? No. Then who is the target- Rajender or me ? (sic)”Seeking to become the judge, jury and executioner all rolled into one, Kejriwal absolves Rajendra and by extension, himself of all real or perceived guilt.By attempting to turn a case of corruption against a government bureaucrat into a personal battle against Modi, Kejriwal trivializes the issue of corruption in governance (a plank on which he was voted to power) and legitimizes the fear that he may have already become a propagator of the very system which he sought to purge in previous violent fits of righteous indignation.Not just that.Kejriwal’s claim that the Centre has initiated “an undeclared emergency” — on which he got vociferous support from Trinamool Congress chief and West Bengal counterpart <a href="http://www.firstpost.com/topic/person/mamata-banerjee-profile-16017.html" title="Mamata Banerjee" target="_self" class="auto-link" >Mamata Banerjee</a>, who is battling Saradha Scam, and from the Congress which is locked in the National Herald imbroglio — is as fantastic as it is ridiculous.If CBI raid on a bureaucrat against whom a corruption probe is under way is a breach of federal structure, then it would be better to simply do away with India’s legislative and judiciary. Thereupon all cases of law and order should be released in the political arena so that ugly mud-slinging freely occupy the social media and news feed.It is unclear whether Kejriwal is speaking the truth when he alleged that the CBI raided his office and sealed it.<div class="lhsBrdBx FL MR20"><div class="title">also see</div><ul class="subArtList"><li><div class="FL"><img src="http://s1.firstpost.in/fpimages/50x37/fixed/jpg/2015/12/Arvind-Kejriwal_Central-Park2_PTI.jpg" alt="Master of the flip-flop: Kejriwal's shrill opposition to CBI raid is hypocrisy at its worst" style="width:50px;height:37px;"/></div><div class="FL PL10 w130"><p class="text"><a href="http://www.firstpost.com/politics/master-of-the-flip-flop-arvind-kejriwal-shrill-opposition-to-cbi-raid-is-hypocrisy-at-its-worst-2545950.html" title="Master of the flip-flop: Kejriwal's shrill opposition to CBI raid is hypocrisy at its worst">Master of the flip-flop: Kejriwal's shrill opposition to CBI raid is hypocrisy at its worst</a><a href="http://www.firstpost.com/politics/raid-on-kejriwals-secretarys-office-based-on-ashish-joshis-complaint-say-cbi-officials-2546328.html" title="Raid on Kejriwal's secretary's office based on Ashish Joshi's complaint, say CBI officials">Raid on Kejriwal's secretary's office based on Ashish Joshi's complaint, say CBI officials</a><a href="http://www.firstpost.com/politics/which-law-says-cbi-must-inform-cm-before-raiding-office-kejriwal-should-apologise-bjp-2546530.html" title="Which law says CBI must inform CM before raiding office? Kejriwal should apologise: BJP">Which law says CBI must inform CM before raiding office? Kejriwal should apologise: BJP</a>Following his tweets which saw an enormous political furore, CBI made it clear that the agency had only searched the office of Rajendra Kumar, the principal secretary as part of an investigation into alleged corruption.In Parliament, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley clarified that “No one from the CBI has entered Kejriwal’s room, the case is not connected to his tenure. The search is against an officer.”In the face of allegations and counter-allegations, let’s also remember that Kejriwal had, during Railways’ demolition of Shakur Basti area in west Delhi last Saturday, alleged that a six-month-old child had died in the incident.However, according to police sources and post-mortem report from Sanjay Gandhi Hospital, the girl had died at least three hours prior to the demolition drive. The girl’s father, too, has come forward and in a police statement, made it clear that his daughter’s death was unconnected to the drive.In the clear pattern that emerges, Kejriwal finds no moral obstruction in using smokescreens and half-truths in making a political point. Last year, during a similar moral outrage on Twitter, Kejriwal had complained about personal abuse that he was subjected to.One year later, in calling the prime minister of the country a “coward” and a “psychopath” for a CBI raid on his bureaucrat and labeling the finance minister a “liar”, Kejriwal has touched spectacularly new lows that may yet set a dubious “benchmark” for adversarial politics in India.more in Politics<a href="http://www.firstpost.com/politics/caged-parrot-turns-political-tool-kejriwals-outburst-makes-him-a-hypocrite-but-what-of-bjp-leaders-2546190.html"><img src="http://s2.firstpost.in/wp-content/themes/firstpost/images/grey.gif" data-original="http://s1.firstpost.in/fpimages/200x150/fixed/jpg/2015/12/Arvind-Kejriwal_Central-Park2_PTI1.jpg" alt="Caged parrot turns political tool: Kejriwal's remarks make him a hypocrite, but what about BJP leaders?" border="0" width="200" height="150"/></a><a href="http://www.firstpost.com/politics/caged-parrot-turns-political-tool-kejriwals-outburst-makes-him-a-hypocrite-but-what-of-bjp-leaders-2546190.html">Caged parrot turns political tool: Kejriwal's remarks make him a hypocrite, but what about BJP leaders?</a><a href="http://www.firstpost.com/politics/what-got-kejriwals-goat-and-why-is-rajendra-kumar-a-thorn-in-his-side-2546480.html"><img src="http://s2.firstpost.in/wp-content/themes/firstpost/images/grey.gif" data-original="http://s1.firstpost.in/fpimages/200x150/fixed/jpg/2015/12/Arvind_Kejriwal_PTI11.jpg" alt="What got Arvind Kejriwal's goat and why is Rajendra Kumar a thorn in his side?" border="0" width="200" height="150"/></a><a href="http://www.firstpost.com/politics/what-got-kejriwals-goat-and-why-is-rajendra-kumar-a-thorn-in-his-side-2546480.html">What got Arvind Kejriwal's goat and why is Rajendra Kumar a thorn in his side?</a><a href="http://www.firstpost.com/politics/which-law-says-cbi-must-inform-cm-before-raiding-office-kejriwal-should-apologise-bjp-2546530.html"><img src="http://s2.firstpost.in/wp-content/themes/firstpost/images/grey.gif" data-original="http://s1.firstpost.in/fpimages/200x150/fixed/jpg/2015/12/Arvind-Kejriwal_Central-Park_PTI1.jpg" alt="Which law says CBI must inform CM before raiding office?

nations form coalition to fight terror, call Islamic extremism 'disease'####http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/14/middleeast/islamic-coalition-isis-saudi-arabia/####Set edition preference:Set edition preference:Set edition preference:<span class="metadata__byline__author">By <a href="/profiles/ed-payne">Ed Payne</a>, CNN</span>Updated 9:23 AM ET, Tue December 15, 2015 <span id="js-pagetop_video_source" class="video__source top_source"></span><span class="metadata__source-name"></span><cite class="el-editorial-source"> (CNN)</cite>Calling Islamic extremism a disease, Saudi Arabia has announced the formation of a coalition of 34 predominately Muslim nations to fight terrorism."This announcement comes from the Islamic world's vigilance in fighting this disease so it can be a partner, as a group of countries, in the fight against this disease," Saudi Deputy Crown Prince and Defense Minister Mohammed bin Salman said.The coalition's formation comes as the West has stepped up its war against ISIS, which is also known by its Arabic acronym Daesh."Today there are a number of countries that suffer from terrorism, for example Daesh in Syria and Iraq; terrorism in Sinai, terrorism in Yemen, terrorism in Libya, terrorism in Mali, terrorism in Nigeria, terrorism in Pakistan, terrorism in Afghanistan and this requires a very strong effort to fight," Salman said.  "Without a doubt, there will be coordination in these efforts."Coalition's joint operations center will be based in Riyadh.In addition to Saudi Arabia, the coalition will include Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Pakistan, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Benin, Turkey, Chad, Togo, Tunisia, Djibouti, Senegal, Sudan, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Gabon, Guinea, the Palestinians, Comoros, Qatar, Cote d'Ivoire, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Maldives, Mali, Malaysia, Egypt, Morocco, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria and Yemen.<h3>U.S.-led coalition</h3>Since September 2014, the U.S. military has been the primary force leading the military campaign against ISIS.About 80% of the coalition bombing has been by the United States, with some support from allies in Europe, plus Canada and Australia. In fact, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/04/politics/air-force-20000-bombs-missiles-isis/index.html">the United States is dropping bombs faster than it can replenish them</a>.<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/10/middleeast/arab-countries-bombing-isis/index.html">Ten Middle Eastern countries have also taken part</a>, but it's a sensitive subject.The Arab allies fighting against ISIS have refused to say how many airstrikes they have carried out against ISIS.  Pentagon statements reveal that half the Arab countries in the coalition have carried out no bombing in Iraq and Syria at all.Bahrain and Jordan haven't dropped any bombs in months, according to a U.S. official speaking on background about the actions of allies, and Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates bomb about once a month.The formation of the Islamic coalition could signal a change in a region that has long left Syria and Iraq to their own devices.The view is evolving now that ISIS has grown into a global network claiming terror attacks from Paris to Australia. "There's been the idea that ISIS is a bigger challenge for Iran and its allies than it is for the Arab states, even though this feeling is changing now," said Fawaz Gerges, a professor of Middle Eastern Studies at the London School of Economics."ISIS has threatened not only Iran and the [Shia]-dominated regimes in Iraq and Syria but even the Sunni-dominated Arab states."Whether the new coalition amounts to any real change in fighting ISIS remains to be seen. "ISIS doesn't just exist in Syria and Iraq -- it has major constituency supporters in almost all Arab countries, including Saudi, Kuwait, Lebanon and Jordan. So they want to really minimize the risks," Gerges said.It's something that has prompted many Arab states to take a low profile up to this point and could still suppress any response in the future even with the announcement of the coalition.CNN' s Jack Maddox contributed to this report.#########Is Angela Merkel Going Back on Germany's Refugee Policy?####http://www.newsweek.com/angela-merkel-going-back-her-refugee-policies-405059#############Journalists Behind Bars: 2015 Report Highlights China, Egypt####http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/journalists-bars-2015-report-highlights-china-egypt-35769431#############Poland says the rumored Nazi ghost train isn't real####http://www.businessinsider.com/rumored-nazi-ghost-train-not-real-2015-12####<span class="KonaFilter image-container display-table"><span><span data-post-image class="image"><img src="http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/5663368984307658008b7b70-3067-2301/rtx1qxpw.jpg" alt="nazi train" data-mce-source="Reuters" data-mce-caption="Journalists visit underground tunnels, which are part of the Nazi Germany &amp;quotRiese&amp;quot construction project, under the Ksiaz castle in an area where a Nazi train is believed to be, in Walbrzych, southwestern Poland September 3, 2015."><span class="source"><span>Reuters</span></span><span class='caption'>Journalists visit underground tunnels, which are part of the Nazi Germany "Riese" construction project, under the Ksiaz castle in an area where a Nazi train is believed to be, in Walbrzych, southwestern Poland September 3, 2015.</span></span><p></span></span>After analyzing mining data, Polish experts say there is no <span>World War II-era Nazi ghost train </span><span>in southwestern Poland, the BBC <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35104117" target="_blank">reports</a>.</span>In November Polish mining experts began analyzing data from the site <span>where</span><span> two amateur treasure hunters said they found "</span><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-2-men-who-claim-they-found-a-nazi-ghost-train-2015-9" target="_blank">irrefutable proof</a><span>" of a Nazi ghost train filled with stolen gold in late August</span><span>.</span>Professor Janusz Madej from Krakow's Academy of Mining said the geological survey of the site showed that there was no evidence of a train after <span class="s1">using magnetic and gravitation methods.</span>"There may be a tunnel.

row with Eurosceptics?####http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-cameron-insight-idUSKBN0TY1AI20151215####<span class="articleLocation">LONDON</span> When David Cameron urges European Union leaders on Thursday to do a deal to keep Britain in the bloc, he will face a riddle that has haunted Conservative prime ministers for three decades: a row with Europe or a row with Eurosceptics at home?Cameron's bid to renegotiate the terms of Britain's membership of the bloc ahead of a referendum he has promised by the end of 2017, has hit the rocks over a demand to make working EU migrants wait four years before getting some benefits.EU partners call that measure impossible while Conservative opponents of membership have pounced on hints that he may drop it as evidence that the renegotiation is a choreographed sham that will end in a fudged deal early next year."If the prime minister is not able to persuade the EU nation states to give us the four-year wait on migrant benefits then it really will be trivial," Steve Baker, a Conservative lawmaker who is campaigning for a British exit, told Reuters."My expectation is that by the time we get to February something will be offered which will be presented as a great success, but that it will still be inconsequential."Baker said he has 136 Conservative lawmakers on his mailing list, indicating that more than a third of Cameron's 331-strong parliamentary party may be toying with the idea of a 'Brexit'.Senior Conservative Eurosceptics are waiting to see the final results of Cameron's high wire act before making their views explicit, though Defence Secretary Michael Fallon quipped in October that "We're all Eurosceptics now".Pro-Europeans fear Cameron could edge Britain towards an accidental Brexit if he overplays his hand in talks to appease skeptics in his party and senior Conservatives who are jockeying for a battle to succeed him due before 2020.A British exit would rock the Union - already shaken by differences over migration and the future of the euro zone - by ripping away its second-largest economy, one of its top two military powers and by far its richest city, London.An exit from the EU could also trigger the break-up of the United Kingdom by prompting another Scottish independence vote. The $2.9 trillion British economy would face years of uncertain negotiations over the terms of a divorce.Cameron says he will recommend Britain stays in the EU if he gets what he wants but has repeatedly warned that he rules nothing out if he doesn't - code for campaigning to leave, a step that would make Brexit highly likely.The timing of the referendum is uncertain but Cameron has said he would prefer it as soon as possible. If he gets a deal in February, as European Council President Donald Tusk has said is possible, the vote could be as early as June."BASTARDS"Opponents of EU membership say that if it took back full sovereignty, Britain could prosper as a global trading center outside a bloc they say has slipped far behind rivals.Opinion polls show British voters are evenly split over membership, with a significant number of people who have yet to makeup their mind, though perceptions that the EU has failed to deal with the migrant crisis may be turning some towards a Brexit.Europe has divided the Conservative Party for three decades and played a major part in the downfall of two of Cameron's two Conservative predecessors, Margaret Thatcher and John Major.Major, prime minister from 1990 to 1997, was undermined by Eurosceptic Conservatives whom he famously called "bastards". Cameron has a majority of 16 in parliament, smaller than Major's after the 1992 election.The EU inflames such passions that Cameron warned in 2006 that the party had to stop "banging on" about Europe.But less than seven years later, under pressure from lawmakers who feared the electoral success of the anti-EU UK Independence Party, Cameron promised a referendum on membership.So far his renegotiation has failed to impress Conservative Eurosceptics who believe the leaders of the euro zone must forge a much deeper political union to save the euro."I just don't think its realistic for Britain to carry on with a small fix when the European Union is so obviously transforming itself in a very dramatic way towards political union," John Redwood, a Eurosceptic Conservative lawmaker, said of the renegotiation.Redwood added that Cameron knew many Conservative lawmakers wanted a complete re-write of EU treaties and that if that was not possible then "we need to leave the treaties".Cameron has demanded a promise than any deal he gets would be enshrined in a future EU treaty."MANUFACTURING A ROW"Up to a third of Cameron's cabinet - including Home Secretary Theresa May, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, Business Secretary Sajid Javid and Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith - have expressed Eurosceptic sentiments."Will they all campaign openly for 'leave' if Cameron is arguing for 'stay'?" asked Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London and author of "The Conservative Party: From Thatcher to Cameron"."Cameron's room for maneuver in cabinet really depends on him: if he thinks he can afford to lose a few people, then he can take a stronger line; if he thinks there's too many of them and that a mass walkout would damage the government's wider credibility, then his options are more limited."Cameron is demanding guarantees to ensure London's financial dominance is not impeded by the closer integration of the euro zone, and he wants a commitment that the goal of ever closer union in the EU treaty's preamble will not to apply to Britain."What David Cameron is asking for is trivial," said Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Vote Leave which is campaigning to leave the bloc that Britain joined in 1973."He knows that unless he can declare victory in February, many of his MPs and party members will be unlikely to back him in the referendum. That's why he is now manufacturing a row to make himself look tough," he told Reuters.Cameron is likely to eventually secure agreement on most of his demands, including a call for better regulation and more open markets to promote growth, though no deal is yet drafted, partly due to the deadlock over in-work benefits.His manifesto pledge to introduce a four-year residency rule for migrants seeking tax credits and social housing has created the most concern because it would discriminate among EU citizens and hence breach EU law and precedent.Official statistics show EU migrants contribute far more to British public coffers than they get back.But if Cameron is unable to achieve changes to the EU's freedom of movement rules, Britons will vote to leave the bloc, according to an ICM poll published on Tuesday.The prime minister says voters are so concerned by immigration that he needs a way to restore "fairness" to the system if he is to recommend staying in, though he said last month that he is "open to different ways of dealing with this issue".When reports surfaced in British media that Cameron would drop his demand over in-work benefits after it got a frosty reception in Romania and Poland last week, his office denied the reports and British ministers insisted the demand stood in the absence of a counter-proposal from the EU.One cartoon in The Times newspaper showed Cameron trying to smash down an EU door with demands before eventually relenting in exhaustion and then knocking politely with a tray of wine. The door opened."Cameron has painted himself into a corner when it comes to in-work benefits for EU migrants: it was a bone he threw to his skeptics without thinking it through," said Bale."But having promised it, he's going to have to deliver something. The problem is whatever he gets now could end up looking worse than nothing at all," he added.

The crisis in Burundi alarms Western powers, who worry it may slide back into conflict after emerging from an ethnically fueled civil war 10 years ago. They fear it could destabilize a region where memories of the 1994 genocide in neighboring Rwanda are still raw."With this latest series of bloody events, the country seems to have taken a new step towards outright civil war and tensions are now at bursting point in Bujumbura," U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein said in a statement.After Friday's fighting, security forces launched "intensive house searches" in Bujumbura's Musaga and Nyakabiga districts, he said. Both areas saw protests earlier in the crisis against Nkurunziza's re-election for a third term.During the searches, the security forces "arrested hundreds of young men, allegedly summarily executing a number of them and taking many others to unknown locations," the U.N. rights chief said in his statement.He urged "all actors in the current crisis, including political leaders and state authorities at the highest level, to take every step possible to stop this deadly escalation and engage in a meaningful and inclusive dialogue."There was no immediate response to from the government, but it regularly dismisses accusations of rights abuses.The government also says it is open to dialogue. Opponents say the government's offer of talks has been a smokescreen because it has failed to allow discussion of core issues, such as the president's current five-year term in office.Opponents say the president violated a peace deal that ended the civil war by seeking a third term. Officials point to a ruling by the constitutional court that said he could run again.

By viewing our content, you are accepting the use of cookies. To find out more and change your cookie settings, please <a href="http://legalterms.cbsinteractive.com/cookies" target="_blank">view our cookie policy</a>.On the day of its deadline for the payment of $548 million to rival Apple, Samsung has filed an appeal to the US Supreme Court to overturn the decision.Despite agreeing to pay <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/samsung-will-pay-apple-548m-in-damages-but-then-fight-to-get-it-back/" target="_blank">$548 million in damages to rival Apple</a> earlier this month, Samsung has appealed to the US Supreme Court in the hope of overturning the ruling.The two tech behemoths have been battling over smartphone design elements in court since 2012, when a jury at the US District Court of Northern California <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-v-samsung-verdict-what-it-means/" target="_blank">found in favour of Apple</a>, after both parties were out for financial restitution of up to $2.5 billion in damages.At issue since 2012 were design features now commonplace on smartphones and are familiar to consumers: A black, rectangular, round-cornered phone front, a surrounding rim, known as the "bezel", and a grid of 16 colourful icons.Those design elements were protected, prompting the nine-person jury to award Apple all the profits from sales of smartphones containing those features, Samsung lawyers said in their filing."While Samsung prefers to compete in the marketplace, not the courtroom, the company feels that it is important to appeal this case to the US Supreme Court on behalf of all US companies, big and small, that could be affected if this legal precedent stands," the company said in an email response to AFP.In a joint court statement earlier this month, the smartphone rivals confirmed that Samsung would, by December 14, <a href="http://1u88jj3r4db2x4txp44yqfj1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/applesamsung.pdf" target="_blank">pay Apple the $548 million</a> awarded to it in September.It emerged in August that Samsung <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/last-chance-samsung-plans-for-supreme-court-appeal-in-apple-patent-case/">may appeal the decision at the US Supreme Court</a>, following a failed bid to contest the damages bill at the US Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. Samsung believed that nearly $400 million of the damages was unfairly awarded.On receipt of the payment, however, Apple said it would withdraw its request for the court to enforce the judgment.The agreement, however, came with one key proviso, as the two tech giants agreed to continue "to pursue the existing cases in US courts".Several of the world's technology titans filed briefs supporting Samsung while the case was in federal circuit court in Silicon Valley, according to the firm.Lawyers for the South Korean consumer electronics titan argued that the massive payout was not warranted, because smartphones "contain countless other features that give them remarkable functionality wholly unrelated to their design"."Even if the patented features contributed one percent of the value of Samsung's phones, Apple gets 100 per cent of Samsung's profits," the appeal said.Apple told AFP that it stands by its comment after the trial victory in 2012."The lawsuits between Apple and Samsung were about much more than patents or money," Apple said. "They were about values. We applaud the court for finding Samsung's behaviour wilful and for sending a loud and clear message that stealing isn't right."In September the US District Court approved a settlement between Apple, Google, Intel, and Adobe, and over 64,000 current and former staff of the tech giants.The verdict made by Judge Lucy Koh saw the end of the four-year class-action case, with Koh agreeing for the four conglomerates to pay $415 million to settle the case.In 2011, Apple, Google, Intel, and Adobe were accused of conspiring in a secret <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-ceo-to-be-questioned-over-apple-google-staff-poaching-pact/">anti-poaching "gentlemen's agreement"</a>, whereby the four companies, and others, secretly agreed not to steal each other's staff.In August, the four companies attempted to settle the class-action lawsuit, but Koh <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/judge-rejects-apple-google-325-million-anti-poaching-settlement-firms-appeal/">rejected their $325 million offer</a>, ruling it was "too low".Koh allegedly rejected the offered settlement amount on the basis that it was <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/anti-poaching-suit-involving-apple-google-intel-and-adobe-hits-snag/">comparatively lower</a> to the $20 million settlement she previously presided over involving Intuit, Lucasfilm, and Pixar.At the time, Koh believed a fairer figure would have been $380 million, noting the "compelling evidence" against the companies. <em>With AAP</em><a href="http://livefyre.com" target="_blank">Powered by Livefyre</a>Legal<a href="/article/accc-hauls-lg-electronics-to-court-over-misleading-statement-claims-again/">ACCC hauls LG Electronics to court over misleading statement claims again</a>Legal<a href="/article/google-may-return-to-china-via-shanghai-free-trade-zone-report/">Google may return to China via Shanghai Free-Trade Zone: Report</a>Telcos<a href="/article/acma-finds-telcos-contravened-tcp-code-with-security-deposits/">ACMA finds telcos contravened TCP Code with security deposits</a>Legal<a href="/article/dallas-buyers-club-precedent-supports-more-compensation/">Dallas Buyers Club: Precedent supports more compensation</a>© 2015 CBS Interactive.

The black, white, and blue version of architect Kyle Lockwood's "Silver Fern" flag was the winner, followed by the red, white, and blue version of the same design. The New Zealand Electoral Commission&nbsp;<a href="http://www.elections.org.nz/news-media/official-result-first-referendum-new-zealand-flag">reported</a> that it received more than 1.5 million votes from a population of 4.4 million for this stage of the selection process, which began with more than&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/8/10/9125785/new-zealand-new-flag-design-referendum">10,000 submitted designs</a>.<q class="right">New Zealand was a British colony until 1907</q>New Zealand's current flag features the UK's Union Jack — a reminder that the country was once a colony of the British Empire — as well as a quartet of stars representing the Southern Cross, a constellation only visible from the Southern Hemisphere. While the new flag's design keeps the stars, the primary emblem is now the silver fern, a plant endemic to New Zealand and well-known symbol of the country. The silver fern itself is salready used by many New Zealand institutions, including the national rugby union team, the All Blacks.When the campaign to choose a new flag was&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nzflag.com/silverfern.cfm">launched</a> late last year, the country's prime minister, John Key, said it was time "for New Zealanders to consider changing the design to one that better reflects our status as a modern, independent nation." However, many of the country's citizens are unhappy about the process, suggesting that the $26 million referendum costs too much and that the event is more of a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/comment/columnists/68392405/duncan-garner-flag-this-irrelevant-debate-and-spend-26m-on-hungry-kids">political sideshow</a> than a reflection of national feeling.Most telling, is the fact that most New Zealanders are happy with the flag they've got. A&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11550614">recent poll </a>showed that 65 percent of the country wants to keep the current flag. Either way, though, the vote is happening, with the final, binding referendum scheduled to take place in March next year.<a href="[%= data.comment.user.profile_url %]">[%= data.comment.user.display_name %]</a>[%= data.comment.user.display_name %][%= data.comment.user.membership.short_bio %]Your flag will not be visible to anyone but moderators.
