Hyeon Soo Lim was found guilty of anti-government activities and of spreading false propaganda, the Chinese state news agency Xinhua said. "The supreme court announced that Lim was guilty of joining the United States and South Korea in anti-DPRK human rights 'racket' and fabricating and circulating false propaganda materials tarnishing the country's image," Xinhua said. His punishment: A lifetime of labor, the agency said. Lim, 60, ministers the 3,000-member Light Korean Presbyterian Church in Toronto. He is a Canadian citizen who emigrated from South Korea in 1986.He traveled to North Korea from China on January 30 on a routine humanitarian trip, a spokeswoman for his family said. He was detained in February. Lim had visited the country over 100 times, his family said. On this trip, he planned to tend to aid projects established by his church in the northeastern city of Rajin, including an orphanage, a nursery and a nursing home."It is this tremendous love for the people of the DPRK that motivated Mr. Lim to travel to the nation over 100 times,"  said family spokeswoman Lisa Pak. <h3>Coerced confession</h3>But North Korea painted a different picture of his motivation. In July, Lim was brought out a news conference where he read from a statement, confessing to activities aimed at toppling the North Korean government, according to the country's state-run news agency KCNA."The purpose that I traveled about several parts of the country on the pretext of 'aid' was to build a base to overthrow the system of the country and create a religious state, taking advantage of the policies of the U.S. and South Korean authorities," Lim said, according to the The Associated Press, which was  present for the news conference. AP reported it was delivered in front of a packed room of Pyongyang-based journalists.Westerners held previously in North Korea have said that their confessions were given under pressure from the state.In April, U.S. citizen Sandra Suh was released from detention in the country and deported to the United States after admitting to "plot-breeding and propaganda against the DPRK," according to KCNA.<h3>A second video</h3>In August, North Korea released footage of Lim confessing again -- <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/04/asia/north-korea-detained-pastor-confesses/index.html">this time at a Pyongyang church</a>. "My biggest crime is my act of blindness in severely insulting the highest dignity and system, the DPRK," Lim is shown saying to a church congregation while dressed in a dark suit and tie. The video was posted on Uriminzokkiri, a state-run propaganda website.The church service took place on August 2nd at Pyongyang's Bongsu Church. There are several places of worship in the North Korean capital, including the Protestant church where Lim appeared. It is known to be used for propaganda purposes but run by state-monitored religious associations.<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/04/asia/north-korea-detained-pastor-confesses/index.html">Canadian pastor detained in North Korea confesses to crimes</a><h3>Behind the scenes</h3>Canada has limited diplomatic relations with the reclusive country. But behind the scenes, the Canadian government waged an aggressive campaign to win Lim's freedom, according to a source with knowledge of the proceedings.Two delegations from the Canadian Embassy in Seoul  held backchannel meetings with North Korean officials in Pyongyang, most recently after Canadian Thanksgiving in October.And Canadian consular officials spoke informally with North Korean delegates on the sidelines of United Nations meetings, the source said.In November, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/12/world/hyeon-soo-lim-canadian-north-korea/index.html">a new set of state officials in Canada</a>, loaded into power after the victory of Justin Trudeau and his Liberal Party in a general election last month, were charged with bringing Lim home. <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/12/world/hyeon-soo-lim-canadian-north-korea/index.html">Canada's election gives hope to family of Hyeon Soo Lim</a>CNN's Dave Shortell reported from New York and Vivian Kam from Hong Kong####(CNN) A Canadian pastor, detained in North Korea for 10 months, has now been sentenced to life in prison there "for subversion.#####Wave of arrests after Pakistan school massacre has unclear results####http://www.reuters.com/article/us-pakistan-attacks-idUSKBN0TZ18820151216####<span class="articleLocation">ISLAMABAD</span> Pakistan has arrested nearly 100,000 people under a counter-terrorism program enacted after a massacre of school children a year ago, though only about 2,000 of them were militants, a senior Interior Ministry official told Reuters.  The rare figures on results of the National Action Plan (NAP) could reinforce critics who say it has resulted mostly in indiscriminate clamp downs that do not solve long-standing security problems.A solemn ceremony in the northwestern city of Peshawar commemorated the deaths of 134 children and 19 adults at a military school in a Pakistani Taliban assault, the deadliest militant attack in the country's history.In a speech in Peshawar on Wednesday, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif barely mentioned the plan, instead focusing on the achievements of military offensives.  "We formulated the National Action Plan," he said briefly, but spent most of his time praising military action along the Afghan border that "has broken the back of the terrorists. It has destroyed their hideouts, their training centers and their infrastructure".Pakistan announced the 20-point plan to tackle militancy after the assault on the Army Public School on Dec. 16, 2014. Among its main thrusts are expanded counter-terrorism raids, secret military courts, the resumption of hangings and promises to reform the justice system.Government officials say the plan is working, and no one disputes violence is down. Militant attacks killed an average of 90 people a month this year, down from 136 the previous year. However, several factors have contributed to the drop in violence: ongoing anti-Taliban military operations predating the plan and a continuing downward trend of attacks over the past few years.Many of those arrested under the National Action Plan have been civilians who say they must pay police to release them, like Afghan fruit seller Khaliq Khan in the northwestern town of Dera Ismail Khan."I did not pay them, because I am legal and have a refugee card," he said. "I remained for 3 months in jail, my family is now afraid and thinking of running away from here."COURTS AND POLICEStatistics on arrests and prosecutions under the plan are rarely made public. In February, Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar told parliament that 12,000 suspects had been picked up.However, Reuters on Tuesday viewed updated ministry figures showing that about 95,000 people have been arrested under the NAP.An ministry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed the figure and said only about 2,000 of those were "hard-core" militant suspects and the rest were arrested for other, unspecified crimes.It was unclear how many of those arrested had faced trial and how many had been freed.Military spokesman Asim Bajwa said recently that 142 cases had been referred to special military courts, but other courts can also handle cases under the plan.Bajwa said military courts had seen "31 hardcore terrorists convicted". Little else is known about those on trial or the legal process, concerns sharpened after the government lifted a moratorium on executions. This year, 319 people were hanged, but the vast majority had no known militant connections, data collected by legal aid charity Reprieve showed.

Serdyukov and Sidorov both received military training, the researchers claim.The outlier in this group is Medvedev, a lawyer by training who has no clear ties to the KGB and did not serve in the military, though he is thought to have undergone brief reservist training during his university years. Since Putin <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/03/russia" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="in-body-link" class=" u-underline">handpicked him to serve as president from 2008-12</a> – between Putin’s second and third terms – Medvedev’s body language has often resembled that of his mentor, as has the cadence of his speech.Citing western media reports, the researchers write that “substantial evidence suggests that Medvedev is being coached to sound, look, and importantly, walk like the president.”The study asserts that Putin’s asymmetrical arm swing is likely “a behavioural adaptation resulting from military or intelligence training.”Bloem conceded that his researchers do not have access to Putin’s medical records or his doctors. But he said Putin’s unusual walk is the subject of a small but growing debate among medical specialists.“It is an unusual study, but there is a very serious message to it” about neurological observation, he told AFP in a telephone interview.Bloem added that Putin’s “abnormal gait has been noted before.” “What we are putting forward, but very cautiously, is a new hypothesis,” he said.<em>A version of this article first <a href="http://www.rferl.org/content/putin-gunslinger-gait-kgb-training-british-study-neurologists/27427829.html" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="in-body-link" class=" u-underline">appeared on RFE/RL</a></em>This discussion is closed for comments.####Study published in the British Medical Journal links Russian president's 'gunslinger gait' with his time in the Soviet security agency.#####Iran's October missile test violated UN ban - expert panel####http://www.reuters.com/article/iran-missiles-un-exclusive-idUSKBN0TY1TD20151216####<span class="articleLocation">UNITED NATIONS</span> Iran violated a U.N. Security Council resolution in October by test-firing a missile capable of delivering a nuclear warhead, a team of sanctions monitors said, leading to calls in the U.S. Congress on Tuesday for more sanctions on Tehran.The White House said it would not rule out additional steps against Iran over the test of the medium-range Emad rocket.  The Security Council's Panel of Experts on Iran said in a confidential report, first reported by Reuters, that the launch showed the rocket met its requirements for considering that a missile could deliver a nuclear weapon."On the basis of its analysis and findings the Panel concludes that Emad launch is a violation by Iran of paragraph 9 of Security Council resolution 1929," the panel said.Diplomats said the rocket test on Oct. 10 was not technically a violation of the July nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers, but the U.N. report could put U.S. President Barack Obama's administration in an awkward position. Iran has said any new sanctions would jeopardise the nuclear deal. But if Washington failed to call for sanctions over the Emad launch, it would likely be perceived as weakness.   Diplomats said it was possible for the U.N. sanctions committee to blacklist additional Iranian individuals or entities, something Washington and European countries are likely to ask for. But they said Russia and China, which dislike the sanctions on Iran's missile programme, might block any such moves.The panel's report was dated last Friday and went to members of the Security Council's Iran sanctions committee in recent days. The report came up on Tuesday when the 15-nation council discussed the Iran sanctions regime.It said the panel considered ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons to be those that can deliver at least a 500-kg (1,102-pound) payload within a range of at least 300 km (185 miles)."The Panel assesses that the launch of the Emad has a range of not less than 1,000 km with a payload of at least 1,000 kg and that Emad was also a launch 'using ballistic missile technology,'" the report said.Iran's U.N. mission did not respond to a request for comment. In October, Tehran disputed the Western assessment that the missile was capable of delivering a nuclear warhead.The panel noted that Iranian rocket launches from 2012 and 2013 also violated the U.N. ban on ballistic missile tests.The chair of the Iran sanctions committee, Spanish Ambassador Roman Oyarzun, told the council the Panel of Experts had concluded the attempt by Iran to procure titanium alloy bars earlier this year also violated U.N. nuclear sanctions.CONGRESSIONAL RESPONSERepublicans in Congress who disapprove of the Iran nuclear deal were seizing on the U.N. panel's findings as grounds for additional congressional sanctions. Even some Democrats supported unilateral U.S. action on the missile violations.Democratic U.S. Senator Chris Coons, a member of the foreign relations panel who backed the Iran nuclear deal, said it was up to the Security Council to act, but if it did not, the United States should, including by imposing direct sanctions on Iranians responsible for the missile tests.While ballistic missile tests may violate U.N. Security Council sanctions, council diplomats note that such launches are not a violation of the nuclear deal, which is foccused on specific nuclear activities by Iran.Iran, which has always rejected sanctions against it as illegal and unjustified, has repeatedly made clear it has no intention of complying with the restrictions on its missile programme.  Asked about the panel's report, British U.N. Ambassador Matthew Rycroft told reporters it was "absolutely crucial that the Security Council upholds its responsibilities and does respond effectively to what appears to have been a breach."The expert panel did not mention a second reported missile test that Iran carried out last month. The panel produced its report after the United States, Britain, France and Germany in October called on the U.N. sanctions committee to take action in response to Iran's test of an Emad missile.Security Council resolution 1929, which bans ballistic missile tests, was adopted in 2010 and remains valid until the nuclear deal is implemented. Under that deal, most sanctions on Iran will be lifted in exchange for curbs on its nuclear programme. According to a July 20 resolution endorsing the deal, Iran is still "called upon" to refrain from work on ballistic missiles designed to deliver nuclear weapons for up to eight years.Although the section of the July 20 resolution applying to missiles is weaker and more limited than the total ban in resolution 1929, U.S. officials have said they will continue to act as if there were a de facto total ban on ballistic missile tests by Iran in the years to come once the nuclear deal is implemented.The experts' report also noted that ballistic missile launches would still be covered by the July 20 resolution.U.S., Iranian and Russian officials have said they expect full implementation of the Iran deal, including the lifting of sanctions, to happen early next year once the U.N. nuclear watchdog confirms Iranian compliance with the agreed restrictions on its atomic work.Earlier on Tuesday, the U.N. nuclear watchdog's 35-nation board in Vienna closed its investigation into whether Iran sought atomic weapons, opting to back the international deal with Tehran rather than dwell on Iran's past activities, diplomats said.U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry welcomed the decision to close the investigation into whether Iran once had a secret nuclear weapons programme.

Members of Ritzer’s family wept.Prosecutors presented voluminous evidence during the month-long trial, including school surveillance videos, to support allegations that Chism followed Ritzer into a bathroom after school, raped and strangled her, and carted her body in a recycling bin to a wooded area off campus.In her closing argument on Monday, Essex County prosecutor Kate McDougall stressed that Chism’s actions were methodical throughout the day of the attack and included bringing bags to school containing a box cutter, gloves and a change of clothes, and later shopping at a store for a hunting knife.“Are his actions … consistent with psychosis or are they consistent with Philip Chism doing what he wants?” McDougall asked the jury.Chism’s attorneys had argued that he suffered from a severe mental illness that had gone undiagnosed for years. Citing the testimony of a psychiatrist who examined Chism, defense attorney Denise Regan said the strain of moving from a supportive community in Tennessee to starting as a freshman at a new high school had triggered a psychotic break.“Philip Chism was under enormous stress,” Regan said in her closing statement. “What other than overpowering mental illness could cause him to commit these acts?”The trial at Essex County Superior Court in Salem, Massachusetts, was occasionally delayed by Chism, who at one point refused to return to the courtroom after a break telling his attorney that he was “about to explode.”####LOWELL, Massachusetts - A Massachusetts jury on Tuesday found a teenager guilty of raping and murdering a math teacher at his suburban high school in 2013, rejecting an insanity defense.#####California shooter messaged Facebook friends about support for jihad####http://financialcv.com/2015/12/california-shooter-messaged-facebook-friends-about-support/####Police: San Bernardino killer used pseudonym, wrote about jihad on social mediaHowever, the day after the deadly shoot-out, a Facebook page maintained by Malik revealed that she had pledged her and Farook's allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State group. The official reportedly said that the messages "went only to this small group in Pakistan", adding that they were written in Urdu, the official language of Pakistan. However, it was not immediately clear if the messages preceded her enrollment.The Homeland Security Department said that it was specifically reviewing policies on when authorities at the US Citizenship and Immigration Services can look at social media posts as part of the vetting process for applicants for certain visas.FBI agents investigating the mass shooting in San Bernardino are trying to determine whether Malik and her husband, Syed Rizwan Farook, had received direct encouragement, financial support, or instructions from a foreign terrorist organization before carrying out the attacks.Before Comey's appearance on Capitol Hill, the Federal Bureau of Investigation had only said that the couple had been radicalized "<em>for some time</em>", but declined to give more detail about their progression to extremism. "It's safe to assume in that in the wake of this tragic occurrence in that we're all going to be taking a complex look at the social media aspect of this", State Department spokesman John Kirby told reporters Monday.

On Tuesday, state regulators proposed new fees for solar customers.Solar proponents have been rallying to block changes to rooftop solar costs. On Tuesday, state regulators proposed new fees for solar customers.Rooftop solar panel owners could face new fees under a proposal issued Tuesday, but state regulators rejected several recommendations by utility companies that threatened the expansion of residential and commercial solar efforts.Southern California Edison and the state's other big investor-owned utilities had pushed to charge more for homes and businesses with rooftop solar panels to connect to the electric grid and use power from utilities when needed. The companies also advocated paying lower rates to panel owners who sold them their extra electricity.Despite the utilities' campaign, the California Public Utilities Commission largely backed the solar industry, which had said the power companies' proposals could have devastated its business.Under the PUC plan, new solar customers would face a one-time fee for connection to the electric grid. The commission estimates that the fee would range from $75 to $150 per solar customer.In addition, rooftop solar customers would pay a fee of 2 cents to 3 cents per kilowatt-hour for electricity used from the utility companies, no matter how much power their solar systems generate. This fee would amount to about $5 a month for the average solar user.California's aggressive push to increase renewable energy production comes with a catch for people with solar panels on the roof: You don't count.If a home or business has a rooftop solar system, most of the wattage isn't included in the ambitious requirement to generate half of the state's electricity...California's aggressive push to increase renewable energy production comes with a catch for people with solar panels on the roof: You don't count.If a home or business has a rooftop solar system, most of the wattage isn't included in the ambitious requirement to generate half of the state's electricity...Utilities also would place new solar customers on time-of-use rates, which rise during periods of high electricity demand.Existing owners are exempted from all the changes for 20 years from when they installed their solar systems and connected to the grid.Sara Kamins, supervisor of the PUC's customer generation program, said the proposed changes are designed to get rooftop solar owners to pay their fair share for maintaining the electric system while ensuring that the added fees don't harm solar-panel owners.The 2-cent to 3-cent fee, Kamins said, helps to pay for programs such as energy-efficiency efforts that benefit disadvantaged communities.&#8220;We're still figuring out what a solar customer's fair share is,&#8221; Kamins said.As for the connection charge &#8212; previously borne by all utility customers &#8212; &#8220;We think they can pay that fee without jeopardizing the economics of the installation,&#8221; she said.The PUC will accept public comment on the proposed fees through mid-January and is expected to make a final decision at its Jan. 28 meeting.At issue is the practice of net metering, in which utilities credit solar users for surplus power their systems create; that electricity gets fed back into the grid for use by other customers. Solar users are credited at the same rate they would pay the utility for electricity.Kamins said the proposed decision leaves the current net metering policy largely intact.<strong><a href="http://www.facebook.com/latimes">See more of our top stories on Facebook &gt;&gt;</a></strong>The PUC's overhaul of the old solar rules was mandated by the state Legislature, which wanted to encourage the continued growth of rooftop solar installations while spreading costs fairly to all electricity users. The new rules would take effect by July 2017.Utility proposals called for changes such as crediting solar users at about half the current rates. Utilities also wanted to charge monthly fees based on the size of a homeowner's solar system, which would have been higher than what the commission is proposing.Southern California Edison decried the proposed decision as insufficient and unfair to non-solar customers.&#8220;SCE wants rooftop solar to expand in California, and there is a more balanced way to get this done,&#8221; said Ron Nichols, Edison's senior vice president of regulatory affairs. &#8220;A much more fair approach would maintain some level of subsidy, but at far lower levels, while rooftop solar continues to grow.&#8221;San Diego Gas &amp; Electric expressed disappointment &#8220;that today's proposed decision on the rooftop solar subsidy does not address the growing cost burden among our customers. Workable solutions must be developed to create a future where all customers can receive benefits.&#8221;&#8220;We will continue to engage the CPUC with the hope of finding a better solution than what is in today's proposed decision,&#8221; the utility said in a statementPacific Gas &amp; Electric said the proposed decision &#8220;falls well short of what is needed to ensure sustainable growth of solar.&#8221;&#8220;Consumer advocates and environmentalists alike agree that change in solar rates is needed,&#8221; Steve Malnight, PG&amp;E's senior vice president of regulatory affairs, said in a statement.&#8220;Some solar company executives will say that the sky is falling if we make any changes, but the truth is that solar's bright future will only be assured by moving forward with smart energy reform. Solar is too important to our state's energy future not to get it right,&#8221; Malnight said.The debate over California solar costs could shape solar policies throughout the nation as utilities seek ways to tinker with the costs and benefits of solar. Other states look to California as an innovator on solar policy. The state by far leads the nation in deployment of rooftop and utility-scale solar technology, followed by Arizona, New Jersey, North Carolina and Nevada.Onerous fees could make solar-power systems unaffordable, industry representatives said.Solar proponents praised the commission's proposed decision and said they looked forward to an even stronger final version for consumers.&#8220;We support the PUC's proposed decision to continue the state's successful net metering policy,&#8221; said Lyndon Rive, chief executive of rooftop solar giant SolarCity. Rive said the proposed decision &#8220;recognizes the important role of rooftop solar in accelerating our transition to a clean energy economy and providing customer choice.Bernadette Del Chiaro, director of the California Solar Energy Industries Assn., said: &#8220;Gov. [Jerry] Brown's PUC is standing up for clean power and for customers by proposing to reject the utilities' attempts to make solar out of reach for customers.&#8221;ivan.penn@latimes.com<strong>Twitter:&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/ivanlpenn" target="_blank">@ivanlpenn</a></strong><strong>ALSO</strong><strong><a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-obamacare-enrollment-20151215-story.html" target="_blank">Deadline to sign up for health coverage extended as applicants flood Obamacare website</a></strong><strong><a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-et-ct-california-ag-harris-comcast-hazardous-waste-settlement-20151215-story.html" target="_blank">California reaches $26-million settlement with Comcast over electronic waste</a></strong><strong><a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-howard-stern-siriusxm-20151214-story.html" target="_blank">Howard Stern signs a new five-year deal with SiriusXM</a></strong><strong>9:23 p.m.:</strong> Updates with additional details and backgroundOriginally posted at 12:41 p.m.Rooftop solar panel owners could face new fees under a proposal issued Tuesday, but state regulators rejected several recommendations by utility companies that threatened the expansion of residential and commercial solar efforts.Southern California Edison and the state\'s other big investor-owned...####Solar proponents have been rallying to block changes to rooftop solar costs.

The company requries users to go by their legal or "authentic" names, which it says makes people accountable for their actions and roots out bullying. However, it has been criticised by advocacy groups, who say it has discriminated against transgender people, abuse victims and ethnic minorities.  The policy has seen many accounts suspended because members went by a different name to the one they were born with, or just because they have been reported by online trolls. Facebook accounts including <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/facebook/12003798/Woman-named-Isis-has-Facebook-account-suspended.html" target="_blank">a woman named Isis</a> and <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/facebook/11824571/Lord-Toby-Jug-banned-from-Facebook-because-they-dont-believe-its-his-real-name.html" target="_blank">Lord Toby Jug</a> have been suspended.  In response to criticism, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/facebook">Facebook</a> said it was testing new options that will make it more difficult for individuals to be targeted online, and allow users to explain why they are using a certain name on Facebook.  Previously, users could report accounts just for using a "fake name", but from now on, people will have to give a reason. This is supposed to make it more difficult for trolls to abuse the system by targeting minority groups or victims of abuse. One user had boasted of taking down <a href="http://www.dailydot.com/technology/realnamepolice-facebook-real-names-policy/" target="_blank">multiple accounts</a>.  <span class="ssImg "><img alt="Facebook's new real names policy tool" src="http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03527/facebook-real-name_3527744b.jpg" width="620" height="569" version="b"><span style="max-width:620px;" class="artImageExtras"><span class="ingCaptionCredit"><span class="caption">Facebook's new real names policy tool</span><span class="credit">&nbsp; Photo: Facebook</span></span></span></span> Secondly, Facebook will allow users to give more justification for the name they are using. When users provide IDs for example, they can say if they have been affected by abuse or stalking, if they are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or queer, or if they are an ethnic minority.  Groups such as <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/facebook/11402531/Facebook-bans-Native-Americans-for-using-false-names.html" target="_blank">Native Americans</a> have seen Facebook accounts suspended because of the policy.  <span class="ssImg "><img alt="Facebook tweaks real names policy" src="http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03527/facebook-real-name_3527760b.jpg" width="620" height="565" version="b"><span style="max-width:620px;" class="artImageExtras"><span class="ingCaptionCredit"><span class="caption">Facebook's new tools are being tested in the US</span><span class="credit">&nbsp; Photo: Facebook</span></span></span></span> "We&#x2019;re firmly committed to [the] policy, and it is not changing," Facebook said.  "However, after hearing feedback from our community, we recognise that it&#x2019;s also important that this policy works for everyone, especially for communities who are marginalized or face discrimination. That&#x2019;s why we&#x2019;re continuing to make improvements in this area."  Facebook said it was testing the tools in the US at first, and plans to change them if necessary before rolling them out globally.  The social network had <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/facebook/11968497/Facebook-to-alter-controversial-real-name-policy.html" target="_blank">promised to change the rules earlier this year</a>, but has defended the policy.  "When people use the names they are known by, their actions and words carry more weight because they are more accountable for what they say," <a href="http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2015/12/community-support-fyi-improving-the-names-process-on-facebook/" target="_blank">it said</a>.

Google has launched a new online game called &ldquo;<a href="https://lightsaber.withgoogle.com/">Lightsaber Escape</a>,&rdquo; which follows Finn&mdash;the star of the new Star Wars film, <em>The Force Awakens</em>&mdash;using his ancient weapon to take on a group of stormtroopers.To play, you&rsquo;ll need a computer and a phone, and a bit of space. Head to the <a href="https://lightsaber.withgoogle.com/">game&rsquo;s site</a> using Chrome&mdash;it will prompt you to enter a unique URL on your phone&rsquo;s browser, which will turn the phone into your lightsaber. Wave your phone around and a virtual lightsaber will follow your every move onscreen.You have to battle through a phalanxes of stormtroopers, and a new type of foe that has some sort of lightsaber-deflecting weapon. Beat that trooper, and you&rsquo;re home free. It took me a few attempts to get through all the troops&mdash;perhaps my <a href="http://www.starwars.com/news/so-what-the-heck-are-midi-chlorians">midichlorian count</a> is just not high enough.The game, Google said in <a href="http://chrome.blogspot.co.uk/2015/12/wield-your-lightsaber-to-escape-first.html">a blog post</a>, was developed in partnership with Disney, Lucasfilm, and Industrial Light &amp; Magic&mdash;Lucasfilm&rsquo;s special effects studio, known to be <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/pga-awards-industrial-light-magic-845513">one of the best</a> in the business. The game has surprisingly decent graphics and plays very smoothly, especially considering it&rsquo;s running inside a web browser, rather than a games console. (Google also broke down the technical wizardry it used to bring the game to life <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/showcase/case-study/lightsaber">in another post</a>.)Google has been on an Empire-like offensive with Star Wars tie-ins in the run-up to the release of <em>The Force Awakens.</em> It let users turn <a href="http://qz.com/557236/google-lets-you-choose-the-light-side-or-the-dark-side-with-this-star-wars-redesign/">their entire Googling experience</a> into a light or dark side fan-fest; it has turned search results into <a href="http://qz.com/558358/google-has-another-surprise-for-star-wars-fans-today/">the slow crawl</a> at the star of Star Wars films; and it has been giving away Star Wars-branded <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/12/11/get-a-free-star-wars-edition-google-cardboard/#.plrdu9:3eu3">Google Cardboard VR headsets</a> to accompany the official <a href="http://www.cnet.com/uk/news/star-wars-goes-virtual-reality-with-google-cardboard/">Star Wars app</a>.With the film opening in Europe today (Dec. 16) and the rest of the world later this week, we&rsquo;ll have to see if Google has any more tricks up its sleeves.

Jordan Smith, ladies and gentleman.”It wasn’t exactly Hail to The Voice, but it was authentic Adam Levine introducing Season 9 victor and Team Adam member Jordan Smith at a press conference after Tuesday's finale of <em>The Voice</em>.The crowning of Smith at the end of Tuesday’s two-hour, star-studded finale, was hardly a surprise, as the 22-year-old Kentucky native was considered the clear favorite in a finalist field that included Emily Ann Roberts (runner-up), Barrett Baber (third place) and Jeffery Austin (fourth place).Smith, who grew up singing in a church choir and has a repertoire that includes pop, gospel and Christian music, said he never assumed he would win, even if others did.USA TODAYPorch shooting defendant grilled by prosecutors“It’s just crazy. You never know what’s going to happen. You have goals and dreams and then always doubt creeps in,” said the singer, who cited a rendition of Queen’s <em>Somebody to Love</em> as a season highlight.  “There were so many times when I did not expect to be in this position. And I’m still blown away by that. This is so surreal, because I never expected it. But I’m so proud to be sitting here."Levine gave Smith, who got a rare four-chair turnaround during blind auditions before the coaches, all the credit for giving Team Adam its third victory in nine <em>Voice </em>seasons.The Team Adam winners “were all so good I couldn’t possibly have screwed it up. … I won because (Jordan is) on my team,” said Levine, saying Smith is a better singer than he is. “It’s fun to be this guy’s coach. Every single time he got on stage and sang, I never had to fake it and pretend to be proud.”Smith, who closed Tuesday's show with a performance of <em>Climb Every Mountain</em>, is not about to rest on his <em>Voice</em> laurels.“I’m at the foot of a huge mountain right now and the hard work is really about to start,” he said, referring to the potential of a singing career ahead.&#39;The Voice&#39; coach Adam Levine, back to camera, hugs Season 9 winner Jordan Smith at the end of Tuesday&#39;s finale.<meta itemprop="copyrightHolder" content="Trae Patton, NBC" />&nbsp;<span class="credit">(Photo: Trae Patton, NBC)</span>Levine issued a challenge to the record labels that handle the post-<em>Voice</em> careers of Smith and other winners, standing by comments he made to Howard Stern. Although <em>The Voice</em> is an Emmy winner and TV's top-rated singing competition, it has yet to produce a big recording star.“There have been some shortcomings on the other side of the fence,” he said, adding that Smith is well situated for stardom. “Jordan has had more success on iTunes than most artists ever have. … At every level, this guy deserves the most success imaginable.“We bring everybody to this beautiful point where there are cameras and everyone wants to know this guy and everyone wants to hear more music from this guy,” he continued. “So, the baton has been passed to the record label and hopefully they’ll do right by Jordan Smith. Right, Republic Records?”At the same time, when a reporter asked Levine what a Smith album should sound like, Levine said the new champ should be able to enjoy his victory for a moment before moving on to the next challenge.“You climb a mountain, no pun intended, it’s great to enjoy the view for a minute before you try to climb the next one,” he said, before adding that Smith’s <em>Voice</em> approach will serve him well in his career. “The way we chose songs was like we were making a record. The songs reflected something about him. I think as long as he keeps doing that it doesn’t matter what kind of record the guy makes.”Levine relishes the opportunity to rub his team’s victory in the face of fellow coach, rival and friend Blake Shelton, who leads <em>Voice</em> coaches with four winning singers from his team.“It feels so good. Oh, man, I’m going to enjoy this night,” he said. “It's really quite beautiful, because Jordan gets to win <em>The Voice </em>and I get to tear Blake apart for the next six months.”<% if ((typeof section !== 'undefined') && section.length > 0) { %><%= section %><% } %><% if ((typeof headline !== 'undefined') && headline.length > 0) { %><%= headline %><% } %>####Spoiler alert: This story contains details from Tuesday's season finale of The Voice, including the name of the winner.

To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the <a href="http://static.usatoday.com/conversation-guidelines/">Conversation Guidelines and FAQs</a><span class="js-caption-wrapper"><meta itemprop="copyrightHolder" content="" /><span class="credit">(Photo: The Associated Press)</span></span>The methodical brand of basketball that Bo Ryan ran at Wisconsin rarely surprised opponents as it piled up wins and two trips to the Final Four over the last two seasons.Ryan saved the biggest shocker of his career for his final game.The 67-year-old coach abruptly retired on Tuesday night, 12 games into the season after his Badgers beat Texas A&amp;M-Corpus Christi two weeks before Big Ten play begins.No farewell tour. No muss, no fuss.Just the way he wanted it. Ryan had discussed retirement for months, but never offered any specific timetable."It is so emotional right now, and I'm trying to hold this together," Ryan said as he began to wrap up his remarks.He had a prepared speech ready to go, printed on a white piece of paper, but decided at the last second to set it aside and speak from the heart in his last news conference as head coach."Can't put that into words," Ryan said. "I can't do that. I've got to tell you how I feel."It was classic Bo — rarely shy to hold back, whether it was about a call, his team or the future.And it's in part what started the "Will he or won't he?" retire drama in the first place.Ryan, who turns 68 on Sunday, said in June this would be his last season. He had told athletic director Barry Alvarez of his plans after the Final Four in April, but Alvarez advised him to give it some time, and not to make a decision right after the end of the season.At a charity golf event in August, Ryan left the door open to return.In making his announcement on Tuesday, Ryan revealed another factor in the timing. He said he would have retired in June, but associate head coach Greg Gard's father had just been diagnosed with brain cancer.Ryan said the demands on Gard's time to fly around the country meeting with doctors and helping his dad put his retirement on the back burner. The elder Gard died on Oct. 30.Ryan later talked to Alvarez. He said that he came to a decision in recent weeks that the semester break would be a good time to step down.Gard was named the interim head coach by Alvarez."Every coach would like their top assistant to be the coach," Ryan said after the 64-49 victory in his final game.Gard is considered one of the top assistants in the game. He has worked with Ryan for 20 seasons, including 14-plus years in Madison.He still has a tough act to follow.With 364 victories, Ryan is Wisconsin's winningest coach.Ryan finished with a career mark of 747-233, good for 27th on the NCAA career wins list when counting successful tenures at Wisconsin-Milwaukee and Division III Wisconsin-Platteville. He won four national titles at Platteville.But it's in the Big Ten where Ryan especially made his mark with 14 straight NCAA appearances and seven conference championships. In 2014-15, his final full season, Wisconsin finished a school record 36-4 and advanced to the NCAA title game, losing to Duke.Those squads relied on upperclassmen and defense in an era of one-of-done headliners. Ryan molded offensive stars, for sure, like Sam Dekker and 2014-15 national player of the year Frank Kaminsky, but players knew they had to play defense and play with smarts to earn time."Thank you Coach Ryan for molding me into a young man," Dekker, who is now a rookie with the Houston Rockets, posted on Twitter. Dekker left after his junior season."Wish I could argue with you one more time," Dekker wrote. "All love to Pops!!"Ryan drew national criticism in 2012 when he tried to restrict forward Jarrod Uthoff from transferring from Wisconsin to another Big Ten school. Uthoff ended up transferring anyway to his home state Iowa Hawkeyes after redshirting for a season.Ryan could certainly be brusque. He tended to have a relatively quiet sideline demeanor during games, but wasn't shy to express his displeasure with calls.Ryan seemed to be in his element especially at practice, where he loved to teach.  Off the court, he could be a charmer and command a room with his stories.A native of the Philadelphia suburb of Chester, Ryan still had a hint of a Philly accent and street-smart persona even after all these years in Midwest.He considered it a joy to be able to lead the Badgers six months longer than he had anticipated."But I knew, I knew the energy level ... the speaking, the traveling, the trying to do other things, to help other people — I enjoy doing it, but the thing was, I felt it was time," said Ryan, his eyes appearing to well up with tears. "But I couldn't make the decision at the time."That time finally came on Tuesday.___Follow Genaro Armas at http://twitter.com/GArmasAP<em>Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Cavs center Timofey Mozgov had nine points and 10 rebounds and protected the rim numerous times.<strong>Heating up again:</strong> The Cavs (16-7) have won three in a row.<strong>Cooled:</strong> The Celtics (14-11) had won seven of 10, with losses at San Antonio and home against Golden State in two overtimes.<strong>Heavy dose of humility:</strong> The Celtics, their fans and the Boston media have been puffing chests and slapping fives over the storied franchise's most recent edition. The Celtics made sure everybody knew how great they felt entering Tuesday's game, their first crack at the Cavs since being swept in the first round of the Eastern Conference playoffs last season.Oh, well.In the final minutes of the fourth quarter, Fox Sports Ohio analyst Austin Carr said: "I don't like to be too forward, but all the things I've read from yesterday to today about this team, the Celtics... They were trying to talk their way to the top, not doing it on the floor. The Cavs have shown them that they are not quite ready to get there.''The talking continued during the game -- notably, Jae Crowder to LeBron. In the end, though, the James Gang had too much talent and brought out the silencers.At the final horn, Fox Sports Ohio play-by-play voice Fred McLeod said: "A wine-and-gold winner. Good night, Boston. No apologies necessary.''<strong>Locking them down:</strong> The Cavs outscored the Celtics, 49-31, in the second half (29-15 in the third quarter, 20-16 in the fourth).The Celtics shot 11-of-42 from the field in the half. Yes, they missed open looks, but much of their struggle was traceable to Cleveland's swarming defense. The Cavs repeatedly fought through screens and took away Boston's first option. &nbsp;Celtics guards Isaiah Thomas and Avery Bradley, in particular, had issues in the early stages of the third. Thomas was unable to shake Matthew Dellavedova and Bradley was checked primarily by J.R. Smith.When Thomas did manage to dribble-penetrate, he changed shots and plans because of Mozgov and Love.The Cavs outscored Boston, 17-4, in the opening seven-plus minutes of the third to take control.Cavs reserve guard Mo Williams capped the quarter in style. After Bradley made two free throws, Williams received the inbounds from Love with 4.9 seconds remaining. Williams used a screen by Richard Jefferson and Tristan Thompson on Bradley near midcourt on the left, then sped in for a layup as time expired.<strong>Love in the air:</strong> The Celtics used a 6-0 run to pull within 79-72 with 6:18 remaining in the fourth. On the ensuing possession, Dellavedova called for Love to isolate against Kelly Olynyk on the left side. Dellavedova passed to Love and cleared out.Love received the ball with his back to Olynyk and immediately faced up. Love dribbled lefty toward the baseline, turned toward the middle, shot-faked to lose Olynyk, ducked back under and scored on a short bank shot.Simple as that.Love schooled Olynyk so badly that Olynyk had no opportunity to grab one of Love's shoulders and rip it out of the socket.Olynyk was rattled enough that, moments later, he missed a jumper. Love rebounded.As LeBron dribbled into the forecourt on the right, Carr said: "I'd go right back to (Love) in the low post.''LeBron, noticing that the Celtics were confused as to who should cover Love on the perimeter, made a lefty scoop-pass to him.McLeod said: "How about out high?''Love drilled the topside 3-pointer.McLeod said: "How about for three? Just like you called it!''Carr said: "Well, I guess I'd go to him at the 3-point line!''McLeod said: "Hindsight is a beautiful thing, isn't it?''Carr, laughing heartily, said: "It sure is.''Cavs, 84-72. Ball game.<strong>Hard hats and shoulder pads required:</strong> When the Celtics play, especially in their house, basketball can morph into any combination of football, rugby and wrestling. Celtics players love to mix it up as much as possible. Tuesday was no different.The Cavs matched the physicality in the first half, but they didn't do what they do best -- play pure basketball.They accomplished both in the second half.<strong>Yawn:</strong> LeBron played well at both ends and posted a +17 in 36 minutes. He got the better of Crowder, again.Crowder pushed and shoved the King, and talked plenty of junk, but it couldn't save him from falling to 1-9 in head-to-head meetings, including playoffs.<strong>Because he can:</strong> With 6:25 left in the third, LeBron delivered the Cavs' post-up of the season. After darting into the paint, he flipped the hips and sealed/overpowered Crowder in a blink, thereby putting himself in prime position to receive Love's entry. King's layup gave the Cavs a 52-50 lead.Yet again, LeBron showed why he is the NBA's most complete player. And to think: Post-ups essentially are a hobby for him.<strong>Wizard of Moz:</strong> Mozgov, who was 4-of-5 from the field, authored his second straight high-impact performance. No revelation here: The Cavs are that much better when Mozgov is playing with energy, scoring here and there, and bothering opposing guards at the other rim.<strong>His Hairness channels LBJ:</strong> The move of the night belonged to....Cavs reserve big Anderson Varejao.Early in the second quarter, Varejao received a pass from Williams at the top of the key. Varejao faked a pass back to Williams, drove the left side of the key, spun on Olynyk and made a layup.The Brazilian show-and-go gave the Cavs a 28-25 lead.<a href="http://videos.cleveland.com/plain-dealer/cavaliers/index.html">See more Cavaliers videos &raquo;</a><a href="http://photos.cleveland.com/4501/category/cavaliers/index.html">See more Cavaliers photos &raquo;</a>####CLEVELAND, Ohio -- LeBron James scored 24 and Kevin Love had 20 points, eight rebounds and five assists as the Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Boston Celtics, 89-77, Tuesday night at TD Garden in Boston.#####A night with the most famous bench in college basketball####http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/maac/2015/12/16/monmouth-bench-mob-celebrations-college-basketball-georgetown/77405260/####SettingsCancelSet You are logged in as <span class="site-nav-user-display-name"></span>Get the newsLet friends in your social network know what you are reading aboutGo backstage with the Monmouth men's basketball Bench Mob and you'll see why they have so much fun.A link has been sent to your friend's email address.A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

They’re quick-witted and not afraid to speak their mind, unless you ask them what their favorite celebration is.“It’s tough to pick a favorite, but I’d have to say, you know what, I can’t answer that,” said Monmouth junior Greg Noack, the ringleader of the most famous bench in college basketball.Just a casual <a href="https://twitter.com/MonmouthBench">@MonmouthBench</a> Mob Dance-Off after beating Georgetown. <a href="https://t.co/VhBGimcA5U">pic.twitter.com/VhBGimcA5U</a>It was the first time Noack was speechless all night, and it’s because he was holding out some big information.“I can’t pick a favorite, because we haven’t released it yet. We have it up our sleeves, and we were going to pull it out tonight but never hit another three to bring it out.”The celebration is titled “The Ace of Spades,” and Noack assured that it would make its national debut soon.The <a href="https://twitter.com/MonmouthBench">@MonmouthBench</a> Mob showed me one their favorite skits - The Heart Attack. <a href="https://t.co/n5UrhYBNCm">pic.twitter.com/n5UrhYBNCm</a>The guys did put on a personal show of their celebration “The Heart Attack,” and even released a new celebration, which happens to be sophomore guard Dan Pillari’s favorite.“<a href="http://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/12/monmouth-bench-follows-through-actually-does-sistine-chapel-celebration-during-game">We’re calling it ‘The Recreation of Adam</a>.’ It shows we can throw a little bit of culture in, shout out Michelangelo and educate the kids a little bit,” Pillari said with a laugh.“We just create energy,” said Noack. “We have a lot more fun at home, but when you walk in the Verizon Center, we’re going to do things like the Sistine Chapel and go fishing.”USA TODAYMonmouth basketball bench turns sideline into sideshowThe impact the bench’s energy brings is seen clearly on the court. The Hawks (7-3) are fluid in every aspect of the game, which brings out the best in the “bunch of goofballs” who are cheering them on. <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2015/12/15/monmouth-shocks-georgetown-83-68/77397046/">Georgetown was the fourth high-major program Monmouth has beaten in the past month</a>, after previously upsetting UCLA in their season opener, then following that up with wins against Notre Dame and USC.“The guys on the floor do what they do, and we do what we do.” says Noack.But what do each of the guys “do?”According to Noack, he and Pillari bring creativity and immense energy to the mob. Pillari’s cousin, Louie, has the same energy, along with “the best jaw line” that Noack has ever seen.

The rest of the Los Angeles Lakers rolled right along with him to a comfortable win.In a rough farewell campaign, Bryant knows it's important to savor good times such as the Lakers' biggest blowout in two seasons.Bryant had 22 points and six assists during a 113-95 victory over the Bucks on Tuesday night in Milwaukee's first game since ending Golden State's unbeaten run at 24-0 to start the season.D'Angelo Russell had 19 points and seven assists as the Lakers took a 22-point lead in the third quarter and cruised to their second victory in 15 games, snapping a six-game skid and improving to 4-21. Lou Williams scored 16 points, while Julius Randle had 14 points and 14 rebounds.Bryant got "M-V-P!" chants throughout the night, and the crowd chanted his name while he relaxed on the bench with the Lakers up 20 in the closing minutes."For me, it's even more special because I want to appreciate every chance to come to this arena," Bryant said. "Just taking it all in, because I know it'll be over in the bat of an eye."Michael Carter-Williams scored 19 points for the Bucks, who played without leading scorer Greg Monroe in their first game since snapping the Warriors' 28-game winning streak dating to last season."It's very humbling," said John Henson, who scored six points while starting in Monroe's place.Monroe was a late scratch with a sore left knee for the Bucks, who have lost 10 straight road games."We missed Moose tonight," Milwaukee coach Jason Kidd said. "But we're not putting this on Moose being out. This is about the guys who had the uniform on tonight didn't give any effort.""We were just kind of going through some things, then somebody tripped and kind of fell into his legs," Henson said. "It happens. So you've got to be ready."They pushed their lead to 18 points in the third quarter on a four-point play by Bryant. Moments later, Los Angeles was up by 22 — its largest lead at any point in the entire season.Los Angeles finished with its largest margin of victory since March 30, 2014 — two seasons, 115 games and 26 wins ago."I think this is the blueprint tonight of how we've got to play every game," said Jordan Clarkson, who had 11 points."He is one of the best to ever play this game, and given the opportunity, he can embarrass you," Kidd said. "And he did that tonight."Bryant shot an airball on his first attempt, but later hit four straight to finish the first quarter with 10 points. He hit three 3-pointers and finished 7 for 15 from the field, building on his improved shooting in the past four games."My legs feel much better," said Bryant, who complained of severe fatigue early in the season. "I feel in a better rhythm. Feels like my legs kind of caught up.""No," he said. "Honestly, no."<strong>TIP-INS</strong><strong>PHOTOS: NBA photo of the day</strong>A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. <em>Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Gamma ray bursts like this are deemed crucial in probing the mysterious evolution of extragalactic background light, which in turn provides clues on the history of the universe.<br /><span style="float:left;">(Photo : M. Weiss/CfA) </span>In April, NASA&rsquo;s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope caught a rare cosmic event: an outburst of gamma rays that has been journeying across the universe. The sensational find helped ground-based observatories detect some of the highest-energy light ever witnessed from a distant galaxy.The gamma rays emerged from PKS 1441+25, an active galaxy known as a blazar and situated so far from the Solar System that it takes 7.6 billion years for its light to reach Earth. This blazar is an extremely bright beacon powered by a massive black hole, with a disk of dust and hot gas surrounding it. Its black hole is estimated to have 70 million times the sun's mass.The flare from PKS 1441+25 was caught by Luigi Pacciani of Rome&rsquo;s Italian National Institute for Astrophysics using publicly available Fermi data. He then alerted the scientific community.What the telescope revealed was gamma rays measuring up to 33 billion electron volts (GeV), going into the portion that shows the highest energy in the telescope's detection range. In contrast, energies in visible light are measured to have between 2 and 3 electron volts only.In a follow-up to the Fermi discovery, the team behind the Major Atmospheric Gamma-ray Imaging Cherenkov experiment, also known as MAGIC, turned to the said blazar and found gamma rays with 40 to 250 GeV energies.&ldquo;Because this galaxy is so far away, we didn't have a strong expectation of detecting gamma rays with energies this high,&rdquo; <a target="_blank" href="http://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/details.cgi?aid=12004"  target="_blank">reported</a>&nbsp;NASA in a press release.NASA <a target="_blank" href="https://www.inverse.com/article/9266-scientists-just-found-gamma-rays-that-are-older-than-earth">cited</a>&nbsp;it was unexpected since distance is very crucial for ultra high-energy gamma rays, which turn into particles once they collide with light with a lower energy. For a better understanding of the distance and age of the gamma rays, the universe is 14 billion years old and Earth has been in existence for just 4.5 billion years. This makes the gamma rays half the universe&rsquo;s age and shows the rays come from a place half a universe away.In their staggeringly long journey to reach Earth&rsquo;s telescopes, the gamma rays also had to pass through the extragalactic background light (EBL), a remnant glow made up of a looser net of photons. Once a gamma ray comes across starlight, it converts into two particles, an electron and a positron, making itself invisible to astronomers - which makes its detection and measurement more astonishing.After this surprising discovery, Arizona&rsquo;s Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS) also caught gamma rays with energies approximating 200 GeV. PKS 1441+25 is one of two gamma ray sources with energies exceeding 100 GeV that have been witnessed so far.The marvelous flare offered a look into the EBL&rsquo;s intensity from a wide range of wavelengths. The measurements, from near-infrared to near-ultraviolet, suggest that surveys of the galaxy have zeroed in on most of the EBL's sources. Since the EBL gets its glow from all the heavenly bodies that have ever existed, probing into it lets scientists track the universe's history.Associate professor Jonathan Biteau, who headed the data analysis as a postdoctoral researcher in UC Santa Cruz, said this development heralds a new era.&ldquo;[W]e can compare source-by-source measurements and start to probe the cosmic evolution of the extragalactic background light,&rdquo; he <a target="_blank" href="http://www.astronomy.com/news/2015/12/gamma-rays-tell-story-of-their-travels"  target="_blank">said</a>.Caitlin Johnson, UC Santa Cruz graduate student and Biteau&rsquo;s co-author, said combining the Fermi data with those from VERITAS enabled them to make constraints on the EBL much tighter. &ldquo;The window is slowly narrowing,&rdquo; she said.The results of the study are to be published in <em>The Astrophysical Journal Letters</em>, which can be <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2041-8205/815/2/L22"  target="_blank" target="_blank">viewed</a>&nbsp;online.<img src="http://assets.techtimes.com/static/common/_v0.0.0/images/popup-subscribe-img.jpg">Enjoyed reading this story?

Exoworlds are now named for deities, demons and scientists.Artist&#8217;s impression of the newly-named planet Thestias around its star Pollux. Credit: NASA/ESA and G. Bacon (STScI).The International Astronomical Union (IAU) — which has been assigning names to celestial bodies <a href="https://www.iau.org/public/themes/naming/" target="_blank">since its inaugural meeting in 1922</a>  — released the winners of its <a href="http://nameexoworlds.iau.org/" target="_blank">NameExoWorlds</a> contest today (December 15, 2015). The IAU is now honoring a public vote to create new names for 14 stars and 31 exoplanets orbiting around them. More than half a million votes from 182 countries and territories contributed to the IAU&#8217;s new official designations of the alien suns and worlds. The new names include Poltergeist, Phobetor (<a href="http://www.godchecker.com/pantheon/greek-mythology.php?deity=PHOBETOR" target="_blank">Greek god of nightmares</a>) and Draugr (<a href="http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Draugr" target="_blank">undead creatures from Norse mythology</a>) for the first exoplanets ever discovered, orbiting pulsar PSR 1257+12 (newly renamed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lich" target="_blank">Lich, or &#8220;corpse&#8221;</a>). It&#8217;s a pulsar, get it? A dead star.Another famous star in the exoplanet community is 51 Pegasi, the first sunlike star known to have a planet. The planet was formerly known as 51 Pegasi b. The IAU has now sanctioned the name Helvetios for the star and Dimidium for the planet.Fomalhaut b is another important star in this context. Its planet &#8211; formerly called Fomalhaut b &#8211; was the <a href="http://earthsky.org/brightest-stars/solitary-fomalhaut-guards-the-southern-sky" target="_blank">first exoplanet ever to be imaged directly</a>. The planet has now been named Dagon, a Semitic deity that’s <a href="http://www.bible-history.com/past/dagon.html" target="_blank">half man and half fish</a>.Other exoworlds received names for famous scientists including Galileo Galilei and Tycho Brahe. Fictional characters from Miguel de Cervantes’s famous novel The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha accounted for a whopping five names.Per the contest&#8217;s guidelines, all the newly adopted names take the form of mythological figures from a wide variety of cultures across history, as well as famous scientists, fictional characters, ancient cities and words selected from bygone languages.Voting concluded on October 31, 2015, with a total of 573,242 votes from the public contributing to the naming of 31 exoplanets and 14 host stars outside our solar system. The public voted on the 274 proposed names submitted by a wide variety of astronomy organizations from 45 countries all over the world — including amateur astronomy groups, schools, universities and planetariums. The successful entries were received from across the globe — four were received from North America (USA, Canada), one from Latin America (Mexico), two from the Middle East &#038; Africa (Morocco, Syria), six from Europe (France, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland), and six from Asia-Pacific (Australia, Japan, Thailand).Here is the list of winning names, with the official scientific nomenclature, the new name, and the winning name&#8217;s country of origin:<a href="http://en.es-static.us/upl/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-15-at-12.56.22-PM-e1450205914755.png"><img src="http://en.es-static.us/upl/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-15-at-12.56.22-PM-e1450205914755.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-12-15 at 12.56.22 PM" width="600" height="473" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-232252" /></a><a href="http://en.es-static.us/upl/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-15-at-12.58.58-PM-e1450205979778.png"><img src="http://en.es-static.us/upl/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-15-at-12.58.58-PM-e1450205979778.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-12-15 at 12.58.58 PM" width="600" height="471" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-232253" /></a><a href="http://earthsky.us1.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=e56e7a92b1c5790f7343ef95a&#038;id=c643945d79" target="_blank">Enjoying EarthSky?

And it&#8217;ll be even more fascinating if we someday learn that some of these distant bodies in space already have names, given to them by extraterrestrial cultures. How about <em>that</em> for an idea?Bottom line: On December 15, 2015, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) released the winners of its NameExoWorlds contest. A public vote chose the new names of 14 stars and 31 exoplanets orbiting around them. Deborah Byrd created the EarthSky radio series in 1991 and founded the website EarthSky.org in 1994. Today, she serves as Editor-in-Chief of this website and blogs frequently about astrophysics, the night sky and other topics related to Earth, space and the human world. She has won a galaxy of awards from the broadcasting and science communities, including having an asteroid named 3505 Byrd in her honor. A science communicator and educator since 1976, Byrd believes in science as a force for good in the world and a vital tool for the 21st century. "Being an EarthSky editor is like hosting a big global party for cool nature-lovers," she says.####The votes are in. The IAU has accepted the people's choice of names for 14 stars and 31 exoplanets. Exoworlds are now named for deities, demons and scientists.#####World leaders must now act quickly to implement Paris agreement####http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/world-leaders-must-now-act-quickly-to-implement-paris-agreement/story-kbW0QcQl59zl4AwpH9W0fK.html####The entire world must urge leaders from across the globe to now urgently implement last week&rsquo;s global Paris agreement on climate change to head off a civilizational threat which transcends borders and governments.Last week, countries agreed to address the problem of climate change for the long term, rather than as a stop-gap measure, to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions in the second half of this century. We must celebrate their effort.However, security impacts of climate change show how its consequences can slip wildly beyond our control and understanding by spilling across borders and creating new consequences. It is vital, therefore, that civil society groups including my own, the Global Military Advisory Council on Climate Change (GMACC), hold governments fast to their targets and explain the consequences of failure.Climate change has both direct impacts and indirect consequences which together present a new challenge for which we have no training. Direct climate impacts include more frequent extreme weather, from the poles to the tropics, from the coasts to the small island states like Tuvalu to the ceiling of the world in Nepal. No country is too big or small, or isolated from the problem.To illustrate, in the past two weeks we have seen costly floods, especially the devastating and deadly one in India and also in Britain. While climate change may reserve its worst pain for developing countries, it will impact everybody.And that global, systemic risk becomes clearer when we consider the indirect effects. Where people are unsafe, they will seek shelter and move as the migration of the troubled people across Europe this year shows.It is not speculation to implicate climate change in the Syrian civil war and a subsequent mass migration across Europe. Syria experienced its worst recorded drought from 2006 to 2011, in turn displacing farmers from scorched fields to over-crowded cities, stirring unemployment and unrest, and ultimately civil war. A recent study showed how a long-term drying trend in the eastern Mediterranean, caused by climate change, had made the Syrian drought twice as likely.Neither is it speculation to draw a further link to the rise of ISIS. We know that marginalised people, in this case uprooted by extreme drought, are a recruitment opportunity for extremist and terrorist groups. We have seen how these groups reach the victims of natural disasters first before the state by responding to and then exploiting their plight.We have seen the impacts: regional conflict, and mass migration. There are now almost three million Syrian migrants in Turkey, or 4% of the population, while a million more are making their way to or are already in Europe. Such migration is not only a problem of human security, but threatens the stability of bordering countries, including Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan, which are becoming overwhelmed.Similar examples abound, where local, climate-related disasters have unravelled on a global scale. Scholars calculate that the Russian heat wave of 2010 was made more acute by climate change. By destroying the nation&rsquo;s wheat harvest, it triggered an export ban and higher global food prices, which in turn saw street protests on the other side of the globe, and provided a catalyst for the Arab Spring.By inflicting social and economic shocks, climate change can also spawn disease, especially in weakened, fragile states, where problems escalate so easily.Water shortages may illustrate best how climate change threatens our most basic needs. At present we are at risk of water-related conflicts in 50 countries on five continents, according to the Global Policy Forum. Scientists tell us that the number of city dwellers facing water shortages will grow to almost one billion by 2050, from 150 million today, partly as a result of climate change.And then there is sea level rise. One metre of sea level rise would submerge about a fifth of the territory of my home country, Bangladesh. The government last week declared that some 40 million people were threatened, risking climate migration on a biblical scale.These examples show how the impacts of climate change are non-linear, a complex web of consequences and new consequences. It is myopic, therefore, for a country to think that the problem does not affect them, because they are not a victim directly. Climate change calls for a deeper understanding and a wider vision of leadership which understands the wider nature of the problem.These are problems not just for leaders, but for all our civilisation.Military leaders increasingly get it. In its latest global strategic outlook to 2045, Britain&rsquo;s ministry of defence warned that some 60 million people would move from desertified areas of sub-Saharan Africa to northern Africa and Europe by 2020, a figure that it said would thereafter increase.The military will see an evolving, humanitarian role, and must work with the wider security community to respond to climate impacts, and be prepared.The GMACC has called on leaders for urgent action to implement the Paris agreement, to save the earth from catastrophic consequences.Politicians are struggling to join the dots on climate change given these new, unchartered demands. All people, including experts, activists and individuals must therefore hold them to account, to ensure that they take the next step, to implementation, and the Paris agreement turns from process to success. ####French President Francois Hollande (L) shakes hands with United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon (C) near Foreign Affairs Minister Laurent Fabius (C), President-designate of COP21, at the World Climate Change Conference 2015 (COP21) at Le ...#####Government-Funded Trials Decrease, Industry-funded Trials Increase####http://www.science20.com/news_articles/governmentfunded_trials_decrease_industryfunded_trials_increase-161949####Examining data according to the first received date, the number of newly registered trials doubled from 9,321 in 2006 to 18,400 in 2014.

The suit, filed in July 2014 in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, does not list which ingredients are believed to be causing damage. Instead, it claims the line uses&nbsp;"numerous harsh chemicals," <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/popular-hair-product-line-wen-sued-allegedly-making-women-go-n480276" target="_blank">according to NBC News.</a>The namesake plaintiff in the suit against infomercial giant Guthy-Renker is a Florida nurse practitioner, Amy Friedman, who claims that after just two weeks of using Wen&rsquo;s Sweet Almond Mint cleansing conditioner in January of 2014, she &ldquo;began losing substantial and abnormal amounts of hair.&rdquo;&nbsp;Friedman said she stopped using the product, purchased in a $29.95 "basic kit," but the shedding continued for about three weeks. When it was over, according to the suit, one quarter to a third of her hair was gone.The lawsuit also accuses Wen of "blocking and/or erasing" negative reviews and comments from its Facebook page.&nbsp;Today, the page is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/WENhaircare" target="_blank">plastered with horror stories</a> of similar hair loss, with many mentioning the class-action lawsuit.A request for comment from a Wen representative was not immediately returned. In November, the company issued a statement to CBS stating that people lose their for a number of reasons and they will "<a href="http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2015/11/11/wen-lawsuit-grows-to-200-including-parents-on-behalf-of-children/" target="_blank">vigorously contest</a>" the lawsuit, now headed to mediation:&nbsp;<em><em>We take great pride in the quality of our products and believe every product meets our high standards.&nbsp;</em>... Importantly, there is no scientific evidence to support any claim that our hair care products caused anyone to lose their hair. There are many reasons why individuals may lose their hair, all unrelated to WEN hair products. We intend to vigorously contest the allegations made against our products. And, we encourage any customer with any questions to contact us.</em><strong><em>Also on HuffPost:</em></strong>Share this slide:####Wen Hair Care is entangled in a class-action lawsuit from hundreds of customers claiming the alternative shampoo products caused their hair to fall out -- in some cases, leaving bald patches and rashes.#####Facebook makes changes to controversial 'real names' rules####http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/facebook/12053011/Facebook-makes-changes-to-controversial-real-names-rules.html####We no longer check to see whether Telegraph.co.uk displays properly in Internet Explorer version 6 or earlier.To see our content at its best we recommend <a href="/browser-support/">upgrading if you wish to continue using IE or using another browser such as Firefox, Safari or Google Chrome.</a>Accessibility links10:07AM GMT 16 Dec 2015 Facebook's controversial 'real names' policy has been tweaked to make it easier for people with pseudonyms or unfamiliar names to use the social network.  The company requries users to go by their legal or "authentic" names, which it says makes people accountable for their actions and roots out bullying. However, it has been criticised by advocacy groups, who say it has discriminated against transgender people, abuse victims and ethnic minorities.  The policy has seen many accounts suspended because members went by a different name to the one they were born with, or just because they have been reported by online trolls. Facebook accounts including <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/facebook/12003798/Woman-named-Isis-has-Facebook-account-suspended.html" target="_blank">a woman named Isis</a> and <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/facebook/11824571/Lord-Toby-Jug-banned-from-Facebook-because-they-dont-believe-its-his-real-name.html" target="_blank">Lord Toby Jug</a> have been suspended.  In response to criticism, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/facebook">Facebook</a> said it was testing new options that will make it more difficult for individuals to be targeted online, and allow users to explain why they are using a certain name on Facebook.  Previously, users could report accounts just for using a "fake name", but from now on, people will have to give a reason. This is supposed to make it more difficult for trolls to abuse the system by targeting minority groups or victims of abuse. One user had boasted of taking down <a href="http://www.dailydot.com/technology/realnamepolice-facebook-real-names-policy/" target="_blank">multiple accounts</a>.  <span class="ssImg "><img alt="Facebook's new real names policy tool" src="http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03527/facebook-real-name_3527744b.jpg" width="620" height="569" version="b"><span style="max-width:620px;" class="artImageExtras"><span class="ingCaptionCredit"><span class="caption">Facebook's new real names policy tool</span><span class="credit">&nbsp; Photo: Facebook</span></span></span></span> Secondly, Facebook will allow users to give more justification for the name they are using. When users provide IDs for example, they can say if they have been affected by abuse or stalking, if they are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or queer, or if they are an ethnic minority.  Groups such as <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/facebook/11402531/Facebook-bans-Native-Americans-for-using-false-names.html" target="_blank">Native Americans</a> have seen Facebook accounts suspended because of the policy.  <span class="ssImg "><img alt="Facebook tweaks real names policy" src="http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03527/facebook-real-name_3527760b.jpg" width="620" height="565" version="b"><span style="max-width:620px;" class="artImageExtras"><span class="ingCaptionCredit"><span class="caption">Facebook's new tools are being tested in the US</span><span class="credit">&nbsp; Photo: Facebook</span></span></span></span> "We&#x2019;re firmly committed to [the] policy, and it is not changing," Facebook said.  "However, after hearing feedback from our community, we recognise that it&#x2019;s also important that this policy works for everyone, especially for communities who are marginalized or face discrimination. That&#x2019;s why we&#x2019;re continuing to make improvements in this area."  Facebook said it was testing the tools in the US at first, and plans to change them if necessary before rolling them out globally.  The social network had <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/facebook/11968497/Facebook-to-alter-controversial-real-name-policy.html" target="_blank">promised to change the rules earlier this year</a>, but has defended the policy.  "When people use the names they are known by, their actions and words carry more weight because they are more accountable for what they say," <a href="http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2015/12/community-support-fyi-improving-the-names-process-on-facebook/" target="_blank">it said</a>.

Google has launched a new online game called &ldquo;<a href="https://lightsaber.withgoogle.com/">Lightsaber Escape</a>,&rdquo; which follows Finn&mdash;the star of the new Star Wars film, <em>The Force Awakens</em>&mdash;using his ancient weapon to take on a group of stormtroopers.To play, you&rsquo;ll need a computer and a phone, and a bit of space. Head to the <a href="https://lightsaber.withgoogle.com/">game&rsquo;s site</a> using Chrome&mdash;it will prompt you to enter a unique URL on your phone&rsquo;s browser, which will turn the phone into your lightsaber. Wave your phone around and a virtual lightsaber will follow your every move onscreen.You have to battle through a phalanxes of stormtroopers, and a new type of foe that has some sort of lightsaber-deflecting weapon. Beat that trooper, and you&rsquo;re home free. It took me a few attempts to get through all the troops&mdash;perhaps my <a href="http://www.starwars.com/news/so-what-the-heck-are-midi-chlorians">midichlorian count</a> is just not high enough.The game, Google said in <a href="http://chrome.blogspot.co.uk/2015/12/wield-your-lightsaber-to-escape-first.html">a blog post</a>, was developed in partnership with Disney, Lucasfilm, and Industrial Light &amp; Magic&mdash;Lucasfilm&rsquo;s special effects studio, known to be <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/pga-awards-industrial-light-magic-845513">one of the best</a> in the business. The game has surprisingly decent graphics and plays very smoothly, especially considering it&rsquo;s running inside a web browser, rather than a games console. (Google also broke down the technical wizardry it used to bring the game to life <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/showcase/case-study/lightsaber">in another post</a>.)Google has been on an Empire-like offensive with Star Wars tie-ins in the run-up to the release of <em>The Force Awakens.</em> It let users turn <a href="http://qz.com/557236/google-lets-you-choose-the-light-side-or-the-dark-side-with-this-star-wars-redesign/">their entire Googling experience</a> into a light or dark side fan-fest; it has turned search results into <a href="http://qz.com/558358/google-has-another-surprise-for-star-wars-fans-today/">the slow crawl</a> at the star of Star Wars films; and it has been giving away Star Wars-branded <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/12/11/get-a-free-star-wars-edition-google-cardboard/#.plrdu9:3eu3">Google Cardboard VR headsets</a> to accompany the official <a href="http://www.cnet.com/uk/news/star-wars-goes-virtual-reality-with-google-cardboard/">Star Wars app</a>.With the film opening in Europe today (Dec. 16) and the rest of the world later this week, we&rsquo;ll have to see if Google has any more tricks up its sleeves.

Introducing, the night light feature!<br /><span style="float:left;">(Photo : Google Play Books Blog) </span>If you've ever experienced the frustration of being torn between wanting to read more from your e-book and putting your device down because the light hurts your eyes for being too bright or insufficient, worry no more because Google released a new update to the Google Play Books app on Dec. 15 that will make e-book reading easier on your eyes.With the night light funtion, there's no more need to squint from the bright light or keep on readjusting the brightness of your device's screen because the Google Play Books update 3.7.45 will automatically do the adjusting for you.Google Play Books Senior Product Manager Greg Hartrell <a href="http://officialandroid.blogspot.com/2015/12/silent-night-with-night-light.html"  target="_blank">posted</a> the announcement on the official Google blog on Dec. 15 and said that the update is rolling out for both Android and iOS users."Night Light automatically adapts to the amount of natural sunlight outside based on the time of day, giving you just the right temperature and brightness," Hartrell wrote.It all has to do with filtering out the blue light emitted by electronic devices, which <a href="http://www.cnet.com/how-to/stop-your-gadgets-from-keeping-you-awake-at-night/"  target="_blank">studies have proven</a> to be the major reason why people have a more difficult time getting a good night's rest. When a user turns night light on, the app will filter the blue light gradually and replace it with the warmer amber tone. Then it's all automatic from there.Hartrell also explained in the blog that the night light update for Google Play Books was conceived after seeing that reading activity around the world peaks from 8:00 P.M. to 10:00 P.M., which is usually just before bedtime. Since studies have shown that bright light, specifically blue light, affects the production of melatonin, the chemical responsible for signaling that it's time to rest, the company decided to make changes in its e-reader to enable users to enjoy reading and still get a restful sleep.<img src="http://assets.techtimes.com/static/common/_v0.0.0/images/popup-subscribe-img.jpg">Enjoyed reading this story?

without the side effect of losing restful sleep.#####Google's experimental wireless service will work with tablets too####http://www.cnet.com/news/googles-experimental-wireless-service-will-work-with-tablets-too/####Google gives folks enrolled in its Project Fi service the option to add cellular-enabled tablets at no additional charge.Google's cheap, alternative wireless service, called Project Fi, is taking another step to shake up the mobile industry.Google won't charge Project Fi subscribers a fee to add tablets to their plan.Google on Wednesday will let Project Fi subscribers with cellular-enabled tablets such as the Nexus 7 and iPad Air 2 hop on its service. All they need is a SIM card, or the tiny piece of plastic that lets your device connect to cellular networks, the company said <a href="https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/project-fi/RQPOse21Aa8;context-" target="_blank" data-component="externalLink">in a blog post</a> on Tuesday. <strong></strong>Project Fi delivers wireless service via a combination of cellular coverage from T-Mobile and Sprint and local Wi-Fi networks. The addition of tablet support is a sign of Google's growing ambitions in the wireless business and reflects its push for change in the industry. The Mountain View, California, company has also been experimenting with features like a seamless handoff between a cellular and Wi-Fi networks.The move also means more choices for customers as Google expands the service to additional devices, including ones made by rival Apple. Project Fi offers consumers who want broader coverage for their tablets -- say, away from home or a coffee shop with a Wi-Fi hotspot -- a cheaper alternative to traditional cellular wireless plans. Those plans often charge customers an extra fee just for the privilege of connecting a tablet."As the number and variety of connected devices continues to grow, so should the number of wireless options," Laura Holmes, the senior product manager for Project Fi, said in a blog post Tuesday. "We'll continue to experiment with creative ways to make accessing wireless from your connected device as easy as connecting with your phone."Google won't charge Project Fi subscribers a fee to add tablets to their plan. All customers have to do is order an additional data-only SIM and put it in their device. Customers then pay $10 per gigabyte of data used each month. As with phones on Project Fi, it will be able to connect to T-Mobile when not near a Wi-Fi network. But unlike the phone version, the tablet won't be able to access the voice network.Customers with AT&amp;T or Verizon plans typically pay $10 just to add their tablet to an existing family data plan, which could cost $100 or more depending on the amount of available data and number of users. <strong></strong>The data-only SIM card for Project Fi will work on five tablets to start, the Nexus 7, Nexus 9, iPad Air 2, iPad Mini 4 and Galaxy Tab S. The tablets have to already work with a cellular network, and must contain a slot for a cellular SIM card. Apple's iPads and the Samsung Galaxy Tab S are the first non-Google devices to be able to use the service, with Google previously restricting it to its Nexus phones.There are other limitations. Tablets that use the data-only SIM card cannot be used as a mobile hotspot for other devices. These SIM cards are only available to Project Fi subscribers, who also subscribe to the $20-a-month voice and text service. Google is allowing customers to connect up to nine devices with a data-only SIM to a single account.Conversation powered by LivefyreThe next Galaxy S7 smartphone is already being talked about; Instagram for Android has 3D Touch-like functionality; and a killer Chromecast deal for the holidays.####Google's cheap, alternative wireless service, called Project Fi, is taking another step to shake up the mobile industry.

Conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan is also feeding the refugee crisis. The influx of migrants to Germany, which has agreed to take the largest number of refugees, has led to a rise in racist sentiments expressed via web platforms such as Facebook.<a target="_blank" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-internet-idUSKBN0TY27R20151215">Reuters</a> quotes German Justice Minister Heiko Maas saying that “criminal expressions, sedition, incitement to carry out criminal offences that threaten people” cross the boundaries of free speech and that such content “has to be deleted from the net”. As with many European countries, Germany has specific <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volksverhetzung">hate speech laws</a>.<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/09/15/facebook-agrees-to-do-more-to-help-combat-hate-speech-in-germany/">This September</a> Facebook agreed to work with the German government to do more to combat hate speech on its platform in the wake of the refugee crisis. It also said it was intending to work with local organizations to do more to tackle the problem — and has partnered with a local Internet safety NGO, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fsm.de/en">FSM</a>.However German prosecutors have also launched multiple investigations into Facebook managers over alleged failure to remove racists posts, including an investigation of its Hamburg-based European head which kicked off <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/nov/10/german-facebook-boss-investigated-hamburg-prosecutors-hate-speech">last month</a>. Facebook has rebutted all these allegations as lacking merit.It’s unclear whether Facebook, Google and Twitter will be increasing local moderation staff to comply with the requirement to delete hate speech within 24 hours. According to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-35105003">BBC</a>, “specialist teams” at each company will be used to assess complaints about hate speech to speed up removal of racist posts.We’ve reached out to Facebook, Google and Twitter for more details and will update this story with any response.Latest headlines delivered to you daily####The German government yesterday secured an agreement from Facebook, Google and Twitter to delete hate speech within 24 hours as it steps up efforts to combat racist sentiments being expressed online in the wake of the European refugee crisis.#####title####http://gadgets.ndtv.com/games/news/final-fantasy-viis-cloud-strife-now-available-in-super-smash-bros-final-downloadable-character-annou-778812####Announced last month, Final Fantasy VII protagonist Cloud Strife is now available on the roster of Nintendo's fighting game, Super Smash Bros for the Wii U and 3DS as a downloadable character.For $5.99 (around Rs. 400) on either Wii U or 3DS or $6.99 (approximately Rs. 468) for both platforms, you get Cloud and a stage based on Midgar - one of the most iconic locations from Final Fantasy VII. Along with this, players will be able to deck up their avatars, or Miis as they're called with Final Fantasy-themed cosmetic items. These include a chocobo hat or an outfit for Geno, a character from Super Mario RPG - a Super Nintendo Entertainment System game developed by Square Enix.<strong>(Also see:</strong> <a href="http://gadgets.ndtv.com/games/features/pokemon-fans-helpless-in-india-as-nintendo-keeps-away-627108" target="_blank">Pokemon Fans Helpless in India as Nintendo Keeps Away</a><strong>)</strong>This isn't all.

There's a stage based on the Umbra Clock Tower - one of the cooler environments in the game as well. Bayonetta for Super Smash Bros on the Wii U and 3DS will be available in February. Much like Cloud Strife, you'll be paying $5.99 to get this DLC on the Wii U or 3DS, or $6.99 for both platforms.####Announced last month, Final Fantasy VII protagonist Cloud Strife is now available on the roster of Nintendo's fighting game, Super Smash Bros for the Wii U and 3DS as a downloadable character.#####title####http://www.techtimes.com/articles/116893/20151216/mozilla-firefox-43-for-windows-finally-goes-64-bit-crushes-various-vulnerabilities-in-the-process.htm####By <a href="/reporters/alexandra-burlacu">Alexandra Burlacu</a>,                   Tech Times  |  December 16, 7:03 AMMozilla officially launched its new Firefox 43 browser, and the biggest highlight is 64-bit support for the Windows version. This will allow for larger apps, faster execution, and enhanced security.<br /><span style="float:left;">(Photo : Mozilla Firefox | Facebook) </span>Mozilla's Firefox 43 browser is now out and about, bringing a number of improvements including 64-bit support for Windows.The new Firefox 43 is available now for Mac, Windows, Linux, and Android, adding several improvements and new features to enhance the overall experience.Firefox users should get the upgrade automatically, but Firefox 43 is also available for <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/?utm_source=firefox-com&amp;utm_medium=referral">download</a>&nbsp;from Mozilla's Firefox website. The Android version, meanwhile, is <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox">available</a>&nbsp;on Google Play.The launch of 64-bit Firefox for Windows, however, is the most exciting highlight of this update. Firefox 43 is compatible with Windows 7 and newer, which means that it should bode well with roughly 80 percent of existing Windows PCs.The addition of a 64-bit version of Firefox for Windows is important because it will now allow users to run larger applications with increased security and way faster execution.While a 32-bit version of the browser can get a maximum of 4 GB of address space, a 64-bit version makes everything smoother. Web apps are increasingly becoming bigger and 4 GB of address space doesn't suffice at all times anymore, but the 64-bit version should fix the problem.Browser-based games should now run a lot faster and smoother, as 64-bit support will better handle their high-quality assets and gameplay."Today we are releasing Firefox 64-bit for Windows to offer gains in performance for users with 64-bit systems. We're pleased to offer it to users of Windows 7 and above looking for added performance for applications and games," Mozilla <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/futurereleases/2015/12/15/firefox-64-bit-for-windows-available/">announced</a>&nbsp;in a company blog post on Tuesday, Dec. 15.When it comes to execution, the 64-bit Firefox 43 can be much faster because it's now able to access new instructions and registers, notably accelerating JavaScript code. At the same time, the larger address space enables Firefox to tap hardware memory protection, while also making address space layout randomization (ASLR) more effective. In turn, this helps prevent malicious content found online from exploiting the browser.On the other hand, Mozilla reckons that the new 64-bit Firefox for Windows currently has limited plugin support, which means that some sites requiring plugins may work on the 32-bit version of the browser, but not in the 64-bit one.Nevertheless, the company reiterated its plans to ditch support for all NPAPI plugins except for Flash by the end of 2016.Lastly, Mozilla also crushed some nasty vulnerabilities with the new 64-bit Firefox 43 for Windows. Four of them were deemed critical, while seven were considered serious. The company <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/known-vulnerabilities/firefox/#firefox43">listed</a>&nbsp;the security bugs after various researchers reported on them.

LG is one of the first companies <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lg-unveils-expanded-us-monitor-and-pc-lineup-with-immersive-new-products-300193443.html">out of the gate</a>, pre-announcing new sound equipment, monitors, and PCs. These new products include a pair of 4K monitors with USB Type-C ports (available in 27-inch and 32-inch sizes) and three new 21:9 ratio ultrawide displays. These feature QHD 3440 x 1440 resolutions and ThunderBolt 2 connections, with two of the monitors incorporating flat displays, and the third — the&nbsp;UC98 — following 2015's trend for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/6/4/8726489/acer-asus-curved-monitors-computex-2015">curved, wraparound screens</a>. In terms of audio equipment, the company will also be showing off a trio of new sound bars, with the two most expensive options offering wireless subwoofers, and all three coming with Bluetooth and Google Cast compatibility. LG will also be debuting three new X-Boom audio systems — the monstrous-looking red and black speakers below.As we said, all of these are pre-announcements only, which means we don't yet have the full specs.

However, American cars also stood out for their resale values, as General Motors took up four of the top ten spots in terms of individual models. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles also had one category winner in the Jeep Wrangler, while Ford was left with none. Another U.S. company, Tesla, won one category with its Model S electric sedan.&#8220;While both Subaru and Lexus deliver incredible resale value, we continue to be impressed with General Motors, which tops domestic automakers with seven combined awards for Chevrolet and GMC and places four of its vehicles in our Top 10,&#8221; said Kelley Blue Book director of resale values Eric Ibara in a statement.Speaking in general, Kelley advised consumers to take a look at several factors when determining if or when to sell their vehicles. These include a car’s price and fuel economy, as well as the ability of specific models to retain their value. Depreciation, in particular, stands out as the number one expense car owners have to deal with in the first five years of owning their vehicles.With that in mind, Kelley Blue Book’s report noted that the average car from the 2016 model year would only retain 35 percent of its original value by the time it turns five years old. In other words, if you bought a 2016 model for $30,000 this year, its resale value would likely be around $10,500 in 2020. The top ten vehicles on Kelley’s list, however, may retain 47 to 62 percent of their purchase price.Still, there are other factors that could affect a car’s resale value.  &#8220;In the colder sections of the country, a two-wheel-drive vehicle&#8217;s resale value often will not be as high as a four-wheel-drive or all-wheel-drive version of that same model,&#8221; explained Kelley Blue Book executive editorial director Jack Nerad. &#8220;In warmer climates, black or dark-colored cars will not have as high resale value as they could command in other regions.&#8221;So we're back with the second part of my preview for WWE's upcoming Tables, Ladders, and Chairs pay-per-view, which takes place tonight at the TD Garden in Boston.

It doesn't seem that any 3D Touch gestures have been added anywhere else in the app, though -- you're limited to these quick actions from the home screen.In a decidedly less useful nod to the classic days of offices gone by, Microsoft has also gone ahead and made it easy to print emails and full conversation threads directly from the message view. The days when it made sense to print emails have long since passed, but if you're someone who really still needs to deal with dead paper, the feature is there waiting for you. Just make sure you consider the environment before hitting print.If you can&#039;t afford a DJ, this feature could become a must for parties.

Part of that push will involve launching a program to train two million new Android developers over the next three years, the company said. To do so, it will partner with more than 30 universities in India.&#8220;Google India started with five employees in 2004 and since then has grown to be amongst the largest Google employee bases outside of U.S. with close to 1700 employees,&#8221; Caesar Sengupta, Google&#8217;s VP for Chrome and Android, wrote in a <a href="http://googleasiapacific.blogspot.hk/2015/12/google-for-india-past-present-and-future.html" target="_blank">blog posting</a>.&#8220;And as smartphones have brought millions more online, Indians have become some of the most enthusiastic Google users.

Excellent news.<strong>NETFLIX is on the verge of rolling out a change that promises to offer better-looking streams, while also reducing data usage by up to 20 per cent. </strong>The streaming service will achieve this by making a tweak to the way it encodes its content.Since 2011, members of the Netflix video algorithm team have been working to revamp the encoding technology, which currently selects a certain bitrate for all titles based on the internet connection available.The new approach will see streaming giant running analysis on each individual title to determine how it should be encoded based on its complexity.&#x201C;Imagine having very involved action scenes that need more bits to encapsulate the information versus unchanging landscape scenes or animation that need less,&#x201D; Netflix wrote on its <a href="http://techblog.netflix.com/2015/12/per-title-encode-optimization.html?m=1">tech blog</a>.&#x201C;This allows us to deliver the same or better experience while using less bandwidth.&#x201D;So essentially, per-title encoding will allow for the best content available based on the speed of the internet connection.Under the previous encoding method, low-bandwidth conditions would have seen an animation like <i>BoJack Horseman</i> playing in the same quality as something complex, like <i>House of Card</i>s streaming in 1080p.However, because the animation is less visually complex than the television show, the new approach will allow it to be streamed at a higher resolution for the same bitrate.White <i>House of Cards </i>would remain the same quality under low-bandwidth, Netflix said under a faster condition, it would also improve because it would be encoded at a higher maximum bitrate than it is currently.The change is expected to be implemented early next year.Business World Columnist Holman Jenkins Jr. discusses the company?s subscriber growth and impressive earnings.

No thanks. I would rather get the Microsoft Band which does more as a fitness band or the cheaper Charge HR.Bull.  The only thing the MS band has over the Moto 360 is the UV sensor.   This come with a Heart rate monitor, barometer, compass, accelerometer, gyroscope, GPS.   Now as far as what this watch comes with.  A higher resolution display that works in any light, 512 MB of ram, 4 gb of storage, WiFi, Bluetooth 4.2, a full fledged CPU.  The MS band doesn't have WiFi, and cannot connect to the internet directly.   For that matter the MS band only has a STMF32 MCU with a tiny bit of ram, and a few MB of storage.   This does so much more than the MS band.  Please continue to show the world how ignorant you really are.You post the same regurgitated bs each time, and each time you're still wrong. Who gives a crap if it has 4GB of storage and can connect to the internet? There's absolutely nothing I would want to store on a watch, nothing. The Microsoft Band doesn't need all of that useless junk because its main purpose is being a fitness band with a crap ton of sensors and it does that well. You're clueless if you seriously think the Moto Sport can compare in that category. It's a smartwatch with a sport band, not a fitness watch. Whatever I can do on an Android Wear watch I can do on my phone where the screen is much bigger and more manageable.This is very bad compared to my Apple Watch SportLet those salty tears of denial continue flowing. Again, no one cares. Stop raining on everyone's parade just because you choose to like Android Wear. Good for you, don't come rubbing it in someone's faces just because they choose to use another platform.i think minimum of a week or two should be the battery life of a smartwatch otherwise they all r garbage even i can say the same to apple iwatch and samsung gear s2 and of the brands r not even in the compitition.  We the people do not want to hang to walls for charging smartwatches, well smartphones have already given a lot of pain to us (in terms of charging) and we do not want the same with smartwatches.It feels to be so uncomfortable.the price is a bit high at this stage&nbsp;####Another day, another Android Wear smartwatch. This time around, we're placing our attention towards Motorola once again, seeing that we just received its upcoming Moto 360 Sport.#####The gender and age breakdown of video gamers might surprise you####http://www.dailydot.com/geek/video-game-players-pew-survey-gender-age/####While many people often think that young men dominate the video-game community, <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/12/15/gaming-and-gamers/">a new survey from the Pew Research Center</a> shows otherwise.<span></span>The study found that 49 percent of U.S. adults are playing video games, whether in the form of PC, console, or mobile device gaming. Within that 49 percent, the percentages of men and women playing games are roughly equal.Maeve Duggan, the lead researcher of the study, told the Daily Dot that that wasn't all too shocking. Since the video-game industry has gained so much popularity, she said, it's no surprise that the gamer population is so broad.As expected, young (aged 18 to 29) male adults make up the biggest demographic of game players (77 percent of them play video games). But older adults make up a substantial amount as well, with 58 percent of adults ages 30 to 49, 40 percent of adults ages 50 to 64, and 25 percent of adults ages 65 and up playing video games.Of all the age categories, the biggest disparity between men and women gamers was in the 18-to-29-year-old category, in which 33 percent of men identified as gamers compared to only 9 percent of women. However, among game players aged 50 and older, men and women identified at roughly equal rates, with four and three percent respectively.The survey also collected a wide range of respondents' attitudes toward video games. Researchers asked about the relationship between violence and behavior, portrayal of women and minorities in video games, and whether video games promoted valuable life skills like communication and teamwork.Duggan said the survey had two main objectives. "We wanted to get a pretty broad read on who's playing video games," she said. "But our second objective was to find out how many people are incorporating games into their lives in perhaps a more substantial way."<em>Photo via <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/36979785@N06/6520290413">Terry Presley</a>/Flickr (CC BY 2.0)</em>####The study found that 49 percent of U.S. adults are playing video games, whether in the form of PC, console, or mobile device gaming.#####
